I met Matteo in the company I work for, he is a very prepared and determined person, Matteo is a mentor, working with him, in addition to being a privilege, is very important: his ability to vision the future combined with external reality, and his way of transmitting it has always been a source of great motivation for me.

Every project, every goal to be achieved, always becomes challenging and at the same time educational. The way in which he structured and made tangible the company's values, which have become our cornerstones, was so engaging that to this day they do not allow us to lose our way.
