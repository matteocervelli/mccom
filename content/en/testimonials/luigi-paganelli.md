The first time I had the chance to talk to Matteo I noticed his natural and determined propensity for all types of innovation.

However, what aroused great interest in me was his idea of organisation, based on creating a structured and internally coherent structure with very clear and long-term objectives.

It is not just a desire to change to improve the process, both productive and managerial, to be able to make those improvements that make company life more fluid, but to "give" everyone a concept of company based on "beauty".

Beauty that must become a belief deeply felt by those who work, by those who supply and by those who buy the company's services/products in order to make it an important point of reference and perhaps to be imitated.
