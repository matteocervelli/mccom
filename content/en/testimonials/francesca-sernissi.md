I've known Matteo for a few years now, because we attended a Master's degree together at the Universities of Pisa, Florence, Siena and Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna... to learn to climb! By participating in the master's course with Matteo I understood that for him climbing is not just a way to reach the top, but above all THE way to determine an impact in the world that is sustainable (from all points of view, i.e. social, economic and of governance) and therefore be successful in the broadest and noblest sense of the term.

We recently found each other, virtually and physically. Every conversation with him is valuable and you always come away enriched with new ideas and different points of view. What else can I say: thank you for the time you dedicated to me and for the enthusiasm you put into everything you do!
