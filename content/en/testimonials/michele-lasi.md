Matteo is one of the brightest minds I've ever met.

After our common path at University, Matteo become a sort of personal consultant to get in touch with for sincere and effettive advices when facing the most complex milestone of my career.

His business acumen, paired with his skills from his deep organizational experience and his talent in motivating and leading teams are remarkable.

I am truly fascinated by Matteo's natural leadership and ability to make things happen. He naturally connects and engages with stakeholders at all levels of an organization by his energetic, positive and easy style.

Tough to find anybody being ever reluctant, defensive or unhappy about working with Matteo: his wisdom and positiveness are contagious!
