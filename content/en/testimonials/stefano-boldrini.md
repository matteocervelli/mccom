Matteo is undoubtedly a person out of the ordinary for the way he is able to think and see certain things and sometimes he doesn't realize this, risking "running alone" but as far as I'm concerned the experience, or rather the opportunity that he gave me and that I would like to tell you about, I believe, represents very well the concept of "talent development" that he carried out.

After having completed a very important training course himself, he decided not to reserve that experience for himself but to share it with me, allowing me to follow the same path, this allowed me to come into contact with people and skills that I would never have imagined and for me this represents a very beautiful and clear form of how to make those around you and in whom you strongly believe grow.

Therefore the image I would like to convey of Matteo is precisely this, a person rich in knowledge but also with a desire to share this knowledge.
