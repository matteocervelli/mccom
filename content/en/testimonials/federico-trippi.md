Matteo is a person with vision, who does not give up reading beyond the surface. He loves to dare to set himself challenges that are concrete but at the same time above the line of "immediately feasible". This attitude can be viral and also allows the people around him to look beyond the immediately achievable results (often of modest value), to set themselves more ambitious and certainly more satisfying goals.

We have built projects together, in the field of research and development. Building a team in front of an idea is always an ambitious and never predictable path because it means putting the needs and desires of multiple subjects into a system. The expected result, the ability to convey the concrete meaning of the idea, so much so as to build a structured work team, is already in itself a great result which, regardless of the funding outcome of the tender, still creates bonds and contacts between people and professionalism.

On the other hand, a CEO works on people and their abilities: this is Matteo's attitude.
