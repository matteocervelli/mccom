I had the pleasure of working with Matteo for a long period during which he proved to be exceptionally reliable and focused.

One of his greatest qualities is his ability to plan and manage complex projects. His ability to foresee different scenarios and create detailed plans has led to significant improvements in operations and processes within our team. Thanks to his far-sighted perspective and attention to detail, he has generated a significant positive impact on our work, contributing to everyone's growth and the achievement of objectives.
