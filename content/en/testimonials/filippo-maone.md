Matteo is a guide who accompanies me towards objectives aimed at personal and work improvement. An ally who taught me to always ask myself stimulating questions, and from their answers I always learned new things. I remember the first day of Kata, with his enthusiasm he involved me in a project that allowed us to overcome challenges that previously seemed like utopias.

In just a few months we have doubled our daily door production, reaching 100 pieces per day. But the thing that made me grow the most was my attitude to change. He gave me the tools, and taught me how to use them, and thanks to this no new role or task scares me, I have been purchasing manager, manager of a production department and delivery manager.

Thanks to him I have achieved a lot of satisfaction throughout my career, and the feedback I have received has helped me raise my professional level. Matteo is the right person to help you and your business reach ever higher levels and transform you into "beautiful" and successful people!!
