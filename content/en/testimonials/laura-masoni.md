Matteo is for me inspiration, support, respect and passion for life. We worked closely together for two years, in which I grew every single day thanks to his contribution.

Matteo is inspiration, because he is constantly looking for new methods, tools, points of view and loves to share all his discoveries. In this way he is a source of inspiration, both for new activities or systems to share, and for being curious and open to new things like he is.

Matteo is support, because he is always available, he never fails to give advice or even just his closeness when faced with a request for help or in a shared activity.

Matteo is respectful of every idea and every point of view, whether near or far from his mentality. He has a deep respect for every person he meets, aware that everyone has value, and creates a climate in which it is easy to express one's potential and one feels safe doing so.

Matteo is passionate for life, at 360Â°, for the human race, for its potential, for hard work, for personal and collective growth and he is contagious in this!

Matteo is one of the best people I have ever met, working alongside him allowed me to get to know and use my strengths and learn a lot. Not only was I able to advance my career in my current company until I joined the management, but I will always carry with me what I have learned and the hunger to continue growing to make the world a more beautiful place.
