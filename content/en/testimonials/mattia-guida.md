You are a person with an extraordinary learning ability, you can see things that others don't see but that will happen.

You travel a lot (mentally) into the future and this sometimes makes you lose contact with the present, perhaps this makes it difficult for you to communicate with other people (difficulty in making yourself understood) but it is precious for boosting activities.

You care a lot about the human side of people, this does you a lot of credit.

When faced with difficulties, it happens that anxiety makes itself felt, this behavior is not always easy to manage for those around you (it depends on their character).
