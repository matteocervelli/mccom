This website was created by Matteo Cervelli using a mix of personal skills and AI. I previously had a website hosted and built on WordPress, but I decided to rebuild it myself in early 2025 to "keep control".

I wanted a lightweight, fast, and responsive website. And I wanted to learn the basics by leveraging what technology has to offer.

First of all, matteocervelli.com is a static website. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as SSG—Static Site Generator—and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) via [GitHub](https://github.com), while DNS is managed through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).

My passion for Markdown comes from a recent transition of all my management to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which I had been "sniffing around" for years until I finally decided to make the switch.

But I couldn't have built the site without two formidable AI assistants: [Claude](https://claude.ai) 3.5-sonnet and [Cursor](https://cursor.sh). Cursor has completely changed my life, while Claude is the best possible learning assistant.

For more information on how I use AI for the site, you can read [here](https://matteocervelli.com/en/ai).

It's only thanks to them that a WordPress XML export was enough to have the entire site in Markdown, organized by folders, through a Python Script.

Today, I write my texts in Markdown, in multiple languages, through Obsidian where I've built the site structure, and then I build them via Terminal (directly in Cursor) on the Hugo folder. For someone coming from a closed CMS system, having everything on my PC is incredibly liberating. Obviously, with continuous backup to Cloud and NAS.

The theme is based on [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke), where I made personal modifications to both style and structure.

The color palette used is:

- MC Purple: #AF00BF
- MC Peach Light: #FFE8D1
- MC Black: #303030

The Fonts are two of my companions:

- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) for headings
- [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) for text

Other tools I use to manage the site and my personal activity:

- [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) for managing Email and digital Drive, plus documentation.
- In Obsidian, I've rebuilt CRM and documentation management and task manager/project manager, so I don't need other software at the moment when I'm working alone.
- [Kit](https://kit.co) for collecting contacts and sending newsletters
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for managing payments.
- [Fiscozen](https://cervelli.link/fiscozen) (for Italian VAT numbers) for accounting — Affiliate.
- [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is) for analytics
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for graphics
- [Clop](https://www.clop.ai) for image optimization
