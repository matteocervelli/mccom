## My Golden Circle

### Why

My purpose is to **trigger people's talent to build a more beautiful world.**

Activating people's potential sparks generativity: it drives people to dedicate their intelligence and time to make the world a beautiful place, spreading love and reducing poverty.

Beauty stimulates positive actions.

I dream of a world where everyone can dedicate their time to meaningful actions, and I want to make this possible through my actions.

### How

I act as The People's Gardener:

- Plant seeds through my vision
- Observe globally, extensively, to understand cultural phenomena
- Use my time and resources to support innovative projects
- Guide others toward their maximum potential
- Leverage languages, interests, and studies to build a broad network
- Transform processes and companies to make them productive

### What

I put my "why" into practice by **helping entrepreneurs scale their businesses** through:

- Management consulting
- Engineered development of strategy and company culture
- Change management
- Implementation of effective processes (sales, design, execution, management)
- Delegation and leadership training

## My Values

**Curiosity**
Continuous exploration of possibilities.

**Critical Thinking**
Rigorous analysis and search for truth.

**Creativity**
Connecting distant points to generate innovation.

**Excellence**
Pursuit of continuous improvement.

**Autonomy**
Promotion of independence and responsibility.

## Core Beliefs

### Faith is a Path of Incremental Knowledge

Error is a source of learning, and life's meaning is to continuously expand one's horizons.
Principles should be constantly refined through experience and reflection.

### Beauty Activates Generativity

Favorable environments allow people to express their hidden potential.
Every person has talent to activate to make the world a better place.
Comfort and beauty are not luxuries but catalysts for human potential.

### Great Challenges Bring Great Results

Choosing ambitious goals leads to exponentially better results.
Challenge is at the center of action: what matters is not the immediate result, but the direction and learning along the path.
Striving for goals 10 times more ambitious costs the same effort and might bring results 5 times better.

## Impact on SDGs

My action positively impacts the following [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals):

## The Common Thread

There's a thread that connects parenting, education, and entrepreneurship: igniting talent. Everyone has untapped potential, and through my work, I commit to making it emerge.

As a leader, this translates into the continuous pursuit of collaborator autonomy, an approach that can be adapted to all contexts, always guided by a greater purpose.

Ultimately, I work to build scaling companies, I work with people, and through a union of intentions, we manage to build ecosystems that bring beauty.
