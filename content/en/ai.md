LLMs are a tool that has recently been taking up a lot of space in the world, and also in how I approach my work.

Although they are not infallible, using these tools has allowed me to enhance my content creation capabilities and also to write code.

Every piece of content you see produced on the site was originally written by me in at least one of the languages I support, namely Italian and English. For translation, I often rely on an auto-translated first draft. Therefore, it may happen that one of the two languages presents verbal forms generated by an LLM that I haven't completely rewritten, especially in older articles predating February 15, 2025, when I published the new version of the site on Netlify.

Although I speak English fluently, I normally use revision systems for logical errors, and lately, my preferred tool is [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org).

I use [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://claude.ai) as an assistant, mainly for research, to support me with the site development procedures. I occasionally use [Perplexity](https://perplexity.com) as an alternative search engine to avoid Data Cutoff Dates. I use all the tools somewhat, including [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), and [Grok](https://grok.com) sporadically, out of curiosity and to test their functionalities.

I use [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) as a code editor, mainly to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. If ChatGPT was a first taste and Claude was my first true love among LLMs, Cursor has literally changed my life. Thanks to Cursor, and its auto-editing functions and the *terrific* Composer Agent, I've been able to develop this site independently, customizing it and making it feel like my own from start to finish, learning to program like never before.

Of the code that makes up this site, 80% has been rewritten and completed by me. Normally, I ask Cursor to pave the way for me, then correct and rewrite in my style. But I notice that as I write, Cursor becomes increasingly precise in adapting to my jargon.

So AI today "assists" me and does the dirty work, but doesn't sign for me.

If I change my approach in the future, I will update this page.
