Updated: 2025-01-18, from my home in Poggibonsi, Tuscany, Italy.

These current projects align with my core [purpose](/purpose-and-values/) of triggering talent to build a more beautiful world. Read more about my [background](/about) to understand how I got here.

## I help companies grow in a scalable way

I am a business consultant and advisor.

My work consists of helping companies grow in a scalable way through Strategy, Change Management, Sales and Business Development, Leadership Training and Coaching.

Many of my entrepreneur friends have noticed that I've switched to the other side of the fence. My strength lies precisely in combining my experience as a family business partner + medium/large company management + international sales with my skills as a Scalability Engineer.

Yet I believe in the power of ecosystems and the need to do holistic and fractal work together to grow the country's system.

My working model is based on 3 phases: assessment, sprint project (with implementation), and follow-up with advisory.

To hire me and get in touch, visit the [Work](/work) page.

## Family Man

I live with my beautiful wife Sara and our 3 daughters, two dogs, in our beautiful house in the countryside. And I live close to my parents to help and support them through my mother's illness.
Maybe not the kind of update you'd expect from a Now page, but it's reality.

## I've Restarted my Blog

I've been writing on this blog for a few years, but I recently changed my approach. I couldn't stand WordPress anymore and decided to start fresh with Hugo and Netlify. I talk about it [here](/tech-stack).
Hopefully, this will also revitalize my social media management.

## Master's Program Professor

I teach in two Master's programs at the University of Pisa: [Master in Scalability & Business Growth](https://www.masterscalability.it) --- dedicated to scalable business growth --- and [Master Industry 5.0](https://www.masterindustry5.it) --- on digital and sustainable industry transformation, focusing on enabling technologies.

Teaching is hard, it requires a lot of preparation work and you always worry that you're not meeting expectations. But I love it because when I finish a session I'm still full of adrenaline; and they say I do it well.

## Business Angel

I collaborate with the Pisa Business Angel Club and invest in startups. My latest acquisition is in [Mokapen](https://www.mokapen.com).

Investing excites me because you can exercise the power to direct your savings towards value-creating projects.

In the end, doing business is also about knowing how to navigate [uncertainty](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility).

## Previously

### Serrall

I managed [Serrall](https://www.serrall.com) as CEO, a company of almost 100 employees that manufactures doors and windows for temporary and off-site modular construction in Europe.

### Pan Urania / Urania Group

I served as CSO at [Pan Urania](https://www.panurania.com), the main company in [Urania Group](https://www.uraniagroup.com), particularly managing first the Brazilian market, then the [Panhouse](https://panhouse.it) project, and finally working on strategy, innovation, talent development, and ESG.
