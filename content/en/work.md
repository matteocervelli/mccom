## Services I offer

### Management Consulting

My consulting services are customized to [unlock your company's potential](/en/business-scalability-engineer) and guide you toward success. Working together, we'll transform challenges into opportunities. I can support you with tailored methodologies, strategic vision, insights, and operational excellence.

My method consists of 3 modes (which together constitute a continuous improvement process):

#### Initial Assessment

Choose your pace, accelerated one-week path or distributed path over a month.

The result is an in-depth report, as a good engineer would provide, that helps identify growth obstacles, how to speed up the business, and the action plan.

#### Project Sprint and Implementation

13 weeks (one quarter) where we will explore, design, and implement the solution to the problems or opportunities encountered.

The goal is to bring tangible and measurable results in a short time, to test few things, but relevant ones.

#### Continuous Advisory

Ongoing support to advise, monitor, and develop company and people processes and capabilities; to set the pace and ensure actions proceed.

I operate with coaching methods in this mode.

### Fractional Executive

I specialize in optimizing business processes.

I thoroughly analyze every aspect to ensure efficient and smooth operation.

My goal is to transform ideas into concrete and meaningful results, offering you a complete strategic perspective to guide your company's success.

Compared to pure consulting, the Fractional Executive takes on responsibility exercised in a reduced space. One/two days a week.

The Fractional Executive is the best answer to bring in skills not present in the company when there's no room for a full-time executive.

### Independent Board Member

As an independent board member, I bring a fresh perspective, strategic vision, and the ability to stimulate reflection through targeted questions.

I am committed to contributing to your organization's growth and success through my experience and unique point of view.

The strength of companies lies in their Relational Capability, in the network they generate.

An independent board member also ensures a much better score for ESG issues.

### Training and Teaching

I strongly believe in the transformative power of knowledge. My training programs are carefully designed to elevate skills, increase confidence, and promote innovation.

Whether you're interested in an academic course, a testimony of my experience, or a corporate training program, I can help you convey an effective message.

Along with training, we can activate support and coaching paths.
