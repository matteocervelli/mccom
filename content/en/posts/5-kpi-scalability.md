Are you driving your company looking only at the rearview mirror?

Revenue tells you where you have been, not where you are going. Healthy and sustainable companies in the long term monitor indicators that can predict opportunities and risks. Leaders know that long-term success requires a complete vision beyond sales numbers.

Do you want to know which are the key indicators that forward-thinking entrepreneurs monitor?

In this article I will show you the dashboard of indicators to constantly update that make the difference between a resilient business and one vulnerable to unforeseen events.

## The Myth of Revenue Growth

When the company grows, it is ready to receive applause: happy suppliers, safe employees, and banks ready to open their hand.

This mechanism is gratifying, but ephemeral. The success of the company is not measured on revenue, and not even on the recognition of external subjects. It is not enough to build a company destined to last.

Confusing increasing revenue as synonymous with company solidity is a common misconception. A company can record record sales and then face important difficulties in the following months. Brilliant numbers can hide structural fragilities.

The truth is that revenue is only a final result, delayed compared to the past.

Looking at revenue as the main metric is like driving using only the rearview mirror.

To navigate towards the future you need indicators that tell you if you are building on solid foundations or if you are just adding floors to a building with structural cracks.

## KPI: The Warning Lights of the Business Dashboard (Leading vs Lagging)

Imagine driving a car looking only at the odometer, ignoring the speedometer, the fuel light, the engine temperature and oil indicators. It is exactly what you do when you monitor only revenue.

You have heard many times about indicators[^1] and probably also about KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), that is the most important ones for driving company performance.

You will already have had the feeling of a mixture of numbers and formulas that add little to the complexities of business management and that are often in contradiction with each other.

These KPIs are the warning lights of your business dashboard.

They are divided into two main types:

- Lag Indicators (from *lagging* meaning delayed): they tell you what has already happened, like the odometer.
- Lead Indicators (from *leading* meaning guiding): they warn you of what is about to happen, allowing you to intervene before it is too late, like the speedometer or the oil light.

The key therefore is to anticipate results using Lead indicators instead of Lag ones.

There is no unique definition of Lag and Lead. No indicator is Lag or Lead regardless, but depends on the objective you want to achieve. Here is an example:

- If the objective is to create a company that grows over the years, revenue is a lag indicator.
- If the objective is to become a leader in a mature market, revenue increase is a lead indicator on the ability to take market share from competitors.

After years of experience studying growing companies, I have identified the 5 key lead indicators that reveal the true ability of a company to grow revenue in a sustainable way:

### 1. LTV/CAC: The Ratio that Predicts Commercial Sustainability

The Lifetime Value of a Customer (LTV, sometimes also called Customer Lifetime Value, CLV) divided by the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the compass of your commercial strategy. It tells you how much value a customer generates compared to how much you spend to acquire it.

**Why it is crucial**: A ratio lower than 3:1 means you are spending too much to acquire customers who do not generate enough value. You can grow rapidly, but you are building a business model that might not sustain itself over time.

**How to interpret it**: An LTV/CAC above 3 indicates a healthy and scalable business model. Above 5 you might paradoxically not be investing enough in growth.

**How to measure it in a simple way**:

1. For CAC: Take all the money spent on marketing and sales in a period (e.g., 3 months) and divide it by the number of new customers obtained in the same period.
   - Example: You spent €30,000 in advertising, commercial salaries, and marketing activities in 3 months and acquired 20 new customers. Your CAC is €1,500 per customer.

1. For LTV: Calculate how much an average customer makes you earn during all their relationship with you.
   - For companies with subscriptions: Average monthly value × average number of months of permanence
   - For repeated purchases: Average spend per purchase × number of purchases per year × years of average relationship
   - For companies that sell on commission: Average commission value × average number of commissions per customer × average gross margin

**Practical examples for collecting data**:

- Consult the invoices of new customers from the last 6-12 months to calculate the average value
- Verify in your accounting documents how much you spent on advertising, events, and salaries of the commercial team
- Look in your CRM or even just in an Excel sheet how many of your customers from 2-3 years ago are still active today
- Collect from emails or orders the number of times an average customer returns to purchase each year
- Ask your accountant to extract the average margin per customer from tax information

### 2. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC): The Speed of Your Capital

The CCC measures how many days pass from when you pay suppliers to when you collect from customers. It is the thermometer of your liquidity.

**Why it is crucial**: A cycle too long means that your growth becomes increasingly hungry for capital. The more you grow, the more capital you need, until you might find it difficult to finance expansion.

**How to interpret it**: A decreasing CCC indicates a company increasingly efficient in generating liquidity. Ideally it should be less than 60 days, but it depends on the sector.

**How to measure it in a simple way**:
The CCC is calculated as: Days of Inventory + Days of Accounts Receivable - Days of Accounts Payable

1. Days of Inventory = (Inventory value / Annual cost of goods sold) × 365
   - Example: If you have goods in inventory for €100,000 and the annual cost of goods sold is €500,000, your inventory days are (100,000/500,000) × 365 = 73 days

2. Days of Accounts Receivable = (Accounts receivable / Annual revenue) × 365
   - Example: If customers owe you €200,000 and your annual revenue is €1,000,000, the days of credit are (200,000/1,000,000) × 365 = 73 days

3. Days of Accounts Payable = (Accounts payable / Annual purchases) × 365
   - Example: If you owe suppliers €150,000 and annual purchases are €600,000, the days of debt are (150,000/600,000) × 365 = 91 days

4. CCC = 73 + 73 - 91 = 55 days

**Practical examples for collecting data**:

- Check the inventory status in the most recent inventory
- Examine unpaid customer invoices in the last 3-6 weeks
- Verify supplier invoices still to be paid
- Talk to the person who takes care of accounting to get the total of current credits and debts
- Use information from the previous year's balance sheet as a starting point

### 3. Gross Margin: The Measure of Your Operational Efficiency

The Gross Margin ((Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100) is the percentage that remains after covering the direct costs of production or delivery.

**Why it is crucial**: A low or decreasing gross margin indicates structural problems in your value proposition or in your operational efficiency.

**How to interpret it**: The gross margin should remain stable or improve with growth. If it decreases while you grow, you are sacrificing efficiency for volume. Each sector has its own logic and there is not an[^2] absolute reference value.

**How to measure it in a simple way**:

1. Take the total revenue in a period (e.g., last quarter)
2. Subtract the direct costs to create/deliver the product/service (raw materials, direct labor, shipping costs, etc.)
3. Divide the result by revenue and multiply by 100

Example:

- Quarterly revenue: €200,000
- Cost of goods sold: €80,000
- Gross margin: (200,000 - 80,000) / 200,000 × 100 = 60%

**Practical examples for collecting data**:

- Use the totals of invoices issued in a period for revenue
- Collect supplier invoices for raw materials and components
- Calculate the hourly cost of direct labor and multiply it by the hours used
- Talk to the production manager to understand the variable costs per unit produced
- Check the end-of-month reports that show the trend of costs per service delivered

### 4. Percentage of Standardized Processes: The Measure of Quality

This KPI measures how many of your key processes are documented, standardized, and therefore easily replicable.

**Why it is crucial**: Without standardized processes, every new collaborator reinvents the wheel. Quality becomes inconsistent and growth brings complexity instead of prosperity.

**How to interpret it**: At least 80% of key processes should be documented before a significant growth phase. It is not just about having manuals, but having systems that people actually follow.

**How to measure it in a simple way**:

1. Identify the key processes of your company (e.g., customer onboarding, order fulfillment, product development, complaint management)
2. For each process, assess if it is:
   - Not standardized (0 points)
   - Partially standardized (0.5 points)
   - Completely standardized and documented (1 point)
3. Calculate: (Total points / Number of processes) × 100

Example:

- 10 key processes identified
- 3 completely standardized (3 points)
- 4 partially standardized (2 points)
- 3 not standardized (0 points)
- Percentage: (5/10) × 100 = 50%

**Practical examples for collecting data**:

- Verify if an operational manual exists for each department
- Check if you have written checklists for important recurring activities
- Ask team leaders if new hires follow defined procedures or "rely on experience"
- Observe if different team members perform the same task in significantly different ways
- Verify if you have indicators to measure the quality of process execution

### 5. Key Talent Retention: The Pulse of Your Culture

This indicator measures the company's ability to retain the most important people, those who embody the know-how, culture, and critical relationships.

**Why it is crucial**: A company that loses its best talents while growing is losing its soul and the institutional memory necessary to navigate change.

**How to interpret it**: A retention (in English *retention*) of key talents above 90% annually is a sign of a solid culture ready to grow[^3]. Below 80% is a clear signal not to underestimate.

**How to measure it in a simple way**:

1. Identify the key roles/people of your organization (typically 10-20% of the total)
2. Calculate how many of these have remained in the company in the last 12 months
3. Retention = (Number of key talents remained / Total key talents at the beginning of the period) × 100

Example:

- 10 key people identified a year ago
- 8 are still in the company today
- Retention rate: (8/10) × 100 = 80%

**Practical examples for collecting data**:

- Review the organizational chart from 12 months ago and compare it with the current one
- Ask each area manager which people they consider "essential" for optimal functioning
- Track exit interviews of people who have left to understand their motivations
- Monitor the number of internal promotions vs external hires for responsibility roles
- Verify if people with more seniority are taking increasingly relevant roles or if they tend to stagnate

## Balanced Dashboard: The Control Panel for Informed Decisions

The key to sustainable growth is having an overall vision, not focusing on a single number - however important.

This is why I invite you to build a balanced dashboard that includes these 5 KPIs.

In this way you will be able to:

- Predict potential criticalities before they impact revenue
- Make decisions based on complete data, not on opinions or impressions
- Balance short-term growth with long-term sustainability
- Create a company culture oriented not only to results, but to the parameters and choices that make them possible

## Tool: Your Dashboard of Essential KPIs

To help you start immediately, I have created a simple but powerful template. You can use it with Excel or Google Sheets:

```text
| KPI | Simplified Formula | Ideal Target | Current Value | Trend | Notes/Actions |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LTV/CAC** | Total Customer Value / Acquisition Cost | > 3 | [Insert] | [↑/↓/→] | [E.g.: "Optimize campaigns"] |
| **CCC (days)** | Days (Inventory + Receivables - Payables) | < 60 | [Insert] | [↑/↓/→] | [E.g.: "Review payment terms"] |
| **Gross Margin (%)** | (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100 | > 50% | [Insert] | [↑/↓/→] | [E.g.: "Increase efficiency"] |
| **Standardized Processes (%)** | Documented processes / Total key processes × 100 | > 80% | [Insert] | [↑/↓/→] | [E.g.: "Document onboarding"] |
| **Talent Retention (%)** | Key talents remained / Total key talents × 100 | > 90% | [Insert] | [↑/↓/→] | [E.g.: "Implement retention plan"] |
```

Adapt the targets to the reality of your sector and the life stage of your company. The important thing is to monitor these KPIs regularly and act when you see signals that require attention.

## The True Meaning of Scalability

Scalability is not just becoming bigger. It is growing stronger, more efficient, more resilient.

Some companies double their revenue but then struggle to sustain the weight of their own growth. Others, perhaps smaller but with solid foundations, manage to seize opportunities that larger competitors cannot afford to pursue.

The difference? The second ones have solid foundations.

This is why I have created a tool that allows you to measure how ready your company is to scale.

**Are you ready to discover if your foundations are solid?**

Complete our ScalabilityScore. It will help you identify precisely where your company is strong and where vulnerabilities might be hiding that could limit your future growth.

Growth without solidity is just a temporary illusion. Let's build together a company that not only grows, but thrives over time.

And makes the world a more beautiful place.

See you soon,

Matteo
