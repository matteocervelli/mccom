Once on the desired profile, scroll down until you find the "Recommendations" section.

You might need to click "Show more" to expand this section, depending on the profile settings.

If you have trouble finding the section, contact the person letting them know you want to leave a recommendation, and they can explicitly request it.

## Step 4: Click on "Give a Recommendation"

Click the "Give a Recommendation" button in the "Recommendations" section. This will take you to a new page where you can leave your recommendation.
