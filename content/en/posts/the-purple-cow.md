*This blog post collects my takeaway from the book: [The Purple Cow by Seth Godin](https://amzn.to/3E4vBx9)*

There is nothing but an ingredient to be successful: being a Purple Cow.

Wait, what's a Purple Cow?

The Purple Cow is a concept defined by Seth Godin to indicate the extraordinary that allows a business to stand out from the mass and build success. It's not just an advantage.

It's the necessary choice.

And, unfortunately, it's not enough.

Having a Purple Cow enables results. But executing your business to deliver the Purple Cow and defend it from false moos is equally necessary. Or defend it from the false sense of extraordinariness that comes from looking in the mirror, ready to destroy it.

Finding a Purple Cow is the foundation.

Here's how:

## 1. Developing an Extraordinary Product

The journey to extraordinary begins with the product itself.
Imagine if your coffee maker could give you compliments or if your shoes could tell you stories about where they've been. It's not about adding bells and whistles to an existing offering but reimagining what a product can be.
This stage is about innovation at its core, solving problems in ways that have never been considered.

> *"In a crowded marketplace, fitting in is failing. In a busy marketplace, not standing out is the same as being invisible."*<br>
> — Seth Godin, The Purple Cow

To develop an extraordinary product, start by identifying the status quo in your industry: What are the accepted norms, and why do they exist?
Challenge these norms and ask "What if?":

What if you could make a product faster, more durable, or more beautiful?
What if you could change the way people interact with it?

These questions are the seeds from which your Purple Cow will grow.
And remember, if at first you don't succeed, it's probably because you're not wearing your thinking cap - or maybe you just need more coffee.

## 2. Finding Your Otaku People

Otaku, a Japanese term, here refers to the obsessive interest that some people have in a topic.
Your product's success depends on these individuals. They're not just customers; they're passionate advocates for your product. They're the ones who will camp outside your store in a blizzard, just for a sneak peek.

> *"Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories you tell."*<br>
> — Seth Godin, The Purple Cow

Identifying your otaku means understanding who is most likely to be passionate about your product.
What specific problem does your product solve, and who suffers most from this problem? Once identified, learn everything about them - their habits, their desires, and their communication channels. These insights will guide not just your product development but your entire marketing strategy.
And if you find your otaku are into something weird, like collecting pictures of cats dressed as pirates, well, that's just an added bonus for conversation starters.

## 3. Creating Initiatives to Present the Product to Your Otaku

After building a deep understanding of your otaku, it's time to present them your product.
This isn't about broad, sweeping marketing campaigns but targeted, meaningful interactions. Think of it as a first date with your partner's parents, but instead of flowers, you're bringing a prototype.

> *"Don't find customers for your products, find products for your customers."*<br>
> — Seth Godin, The Purple Cow

Create experiences that allow your otaku to deeply engage with your product.
This could be through exclusive beta testing, community forums, or live interactive events. The goal is to create a memorable, engaging experience that they will want to share. Remember, your otaku are your first and most important marketers.
And if all else fails, you can always bribe them with cookies - everyone loves cookies.

## 4. Ensuring Sneezers Spread the Word at the Right Time

"Sneezers," as Godin describes them, will be the first people likely to spread the word about your product.
They're a subset of your otaku, the ones who can't wait to tell others about their discoveries. They're like your product's personal cheerleading squad, minus the pom-poms.

> *"Ideas that spread, win."*<br>
> — Seth Godin, The Purple Cow

Timing is critical.
You want Sneezers to start talking when your product is ready to be shared, not before it's fully realized. Coordinate product launches, announcements, and special events to create buzz that sneezes can amplify. Provide them with the tools they need to share easily and widely, through social media, blogs, or forums.
And if you can get them to do a synchronized dance about your product, even better.

## 5. Facilitating the Probability of Cross-Pollination

Cross-pollination here refers to the spread of your product's idea from one group to another.
It's the viral effect that every marketer dreams of. It's like telling one person a joke and, by the end of the day, the entire office is laughing.

"The secret to successful sneezing is to be in front of a group that's predisposed to listen."
— Seth Godin, The Purple Cow

To facilitate this spread, you need to understand the networks your otaku and sneezers inhabit.

What other interests do they have?
What other groups do they belong to?

By understanding these networks, you can present your product in a way that feels natural and welcome. This might involve partnering with other companies, engaging with influencers, or creating content that's easily shared across different platforms.
And remember, the goal is to make your product the next big thing, not the next big meme (unless that's your thing, then meme away!).

## Conclusion

Creating a Purple Cow is not a one-time act; it's a continuous process of innovation, understanding, engagement, and refinement.
It's about creating something truly remarkable and then letting the world know about it: by developing an extraordinary product, finding and engaging with your otaku, ensuring sneezers spread the word at the right time, and facilitating cross-pollination, you're not just building a product.
You're building a movement.
And possibly a cult following, but let's stick with movement for now.
Remember, the Purple Cow is not just a metaphor.
It's a call to action. It's a challenge to be daring, to be different, and to be truly remarkable. In the words of Seth Godin, "In a world of brown cows, your only chance to score is to not be brown."
So, what color will your cow be? Will it be purple, polka-dotted, or maybe even rainbow?
The choice is yours, and the pasture is waiting.
Now go out there and make some moos - I mean, moves!
