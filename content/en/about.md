## In short

I'm Matteo Cervelli. I am [Business Scalability Engineer](/work/business-scalability-engineer). I act as a [Consultant and Advisor](/work). Previously I managed [Urania Group](https://www.urania.group) as Co-CEO.

Today I help entrepreneurs and leaders to grow their business, in strategy, management, sales, implementing the principles of scalability.

My purpose is to trigger people to build a more beautiful world, together.

I am a father of 3 little girls, Emma, ​​Maria and Emma, ​​and two dogs: Maple and Cookie. Even before that, I am a husband: Sara and I have known each other since 2005 and in these 20 years we have loved each other and have always been there for each other, one, two and infinite.

I live in Tuscany.

## Welcome to my garden
This is my digital home. You can find my thoughts, my writings and how to work with me.

Ultimately, I work to build businesses that scale, I work with people and through a union of purpose, we are able to build ecosystems that bring beauty.

There is a thread that unites parenting, education and doing business: triggering talent. Everyone has unexpressed potential and through my work, I strive to ensure that this emerges. 

As a leader, this translates into the continuous search for autonomy of collaborators, an approach that can be adapted to all contexts. Driven by purpose.

## My main skills
My main advantage is that of having operated as CEO of a medium/large company, present in many countries. In addition to speaking many languages, English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, in addition to my mother tongue Italian, I have seen many cultures and learned to sell by going directly to customers' homes.

I have dealt with entrepreneurs and managers of large billion-dollar companies, financed by Private Equity. 

In the company, a "modern" Family Business, I saw M&A, strategy, finance and specialized in change management, a skill, a real method for grounding changes.

As an Engineer, I build methods, or apply them, to make things more effective. By the way, I'm always looking for ways to make processes more repeatable and scalable, exponentially.
