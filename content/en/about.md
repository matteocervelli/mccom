## In short

I'm Matteo Cervelli. I am a [Business Scalability Engineer](/business-scalability-engineer). I act as a [Consultant and Advisor](/work). Previously I managed [Urania Group](https://urania.group) as Co-CEO.

My purpose is to trigger people to build a more beautiful world, together. Today I help entrepreneurs and leaders grow their business through strategic development, effective management, and scalable sales processes.

I have been Sara's husband for over 10 years, father of 3 little girls, Emma, Maria and Anna, and two dogs (Maple and Cookie). I live in Tuscany.

## What I do

I activate talents, build beauty, scale on impact.

Beauty leads people to generativity, to apply their intelligence in building a better world.

### My main skills

My main advantage is having operated as CEO of a medium/large company, present in many countries. In addition to speaking many languages - English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, besides my native Italian - I have seen many cultures and learned to sell by going directly to customers' homes.

I have dealt with entrepreneurs and managers of large billion-dollar companies, financed by Private Equity.

In the company, a "modern" Family Business, I saw M&A, strategy, finance and specialized in change management, a skill, a real method for grounding changes.

As an Engineer, I build methods, or apply them, to make things more effective. By the way, I'm always looking for ways to make processes more repeatable and scalable, exponential.
