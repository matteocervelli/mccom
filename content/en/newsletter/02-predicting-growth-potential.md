In this newsletter, I'm going to explain **how to accurately predict if your company is ready to scale** and grow sustainably.

Being able to predict your company's growth potential allows you to make strategic decisions with confidence, attract investors with concrete data, and build a business that not only grows but thrives over time. Imagine being able to **anticipate challenges and opportunities** instead of constantly reacting to emergencies.

Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs continue to drive looking only in the rearview mirror, focusing solely on revenue as an indicator of success.

## Revenue is a lagging indicator, not a predictor of the future

Many entrepreneurs fail to accurately predict their growth potential for several reasons:

- **They confuse growth with scalability**: Increasing revenue doesn't necessarily mean building a stronger, more resilient company.
- **They lack predictive indicators (Lead KPIs)**: They rely on metrics showing the past (Lag KPIs) instead of signaling what's about to happen.
- **They don't measure what truly matters**: They overlook crucial indicators like cash conversion cycle (CCC) and operational efficiency (Gross Margin).
- **They ignore internal signals**: They pay no attention to process standardization and key talent retention.

But there's a solution! You can overcome these challenges by implementing a system of predictive KPIs that will show you exactly where to intervene before it's too late.

Here's how, step by step:

## Step 1: Monitor the LTV/CAC ratio to verify commercial sustainability

This ratio is fundamental because it tells you how much value a customer generates compared to how much you spend to acquire them. An LTV/CAC below 3:1 means you're spending too much to acquire customers who don't generate enough value over time. I've seen companies triple their profitability simply by optimizing this indicator, like an e-commerce business that went from a 2.1 to 4.5 ratio in six months by redefining its acquisition strategy. Calculate it by dividing the average customer lifetime value by the average customer acquisition cost.

## Step 2: Calculate and optimize your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

Many overlook this indicator, thinking it's just an administrative issue. However, a CCC (Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payables Outstanding) that is too long means your growth consumes capital faster and faster. The common mistake is not constantly monitoring these three components. To avoid the cash trap, systematically measure these days and aim for a CCC below 60 (or your industry standard).

## Step 3: Integrate Gross Margin, Standardized Processes, and Talent Retention

The light at the end of the tunnel is a complete view of your ability to scale. These three indicators (Gross Margin for operational efficiency, % Standardized Processes for replicability, % Talent Retention for know-how) complete the picture. Together with the first two, they form a predictive dashboard. A manufacturing SME used this complete system to correct inefficiencies and high talent turnover hidden behind growing revenue, doubling both profitability and revenue in the following two years.
