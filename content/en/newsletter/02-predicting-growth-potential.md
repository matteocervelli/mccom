In this edition of Scalability Compass, I'll show you 5 metrics that can predict your company's ability to scale and grow sustainably.

Being able to predict your company's growth potential allows you to make strategic decisions with confidence, attract investors with concrete data, and build a business that not only grows but thrives over time. Imagine being able to anticipate challenges and opportunities instead of constantly reacting to emergencies.

Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs continue to drive looking only in the rearview mirror, focusing solely on revenue as an indicator of success.

## **Revenue is a lagging indicator, not a predictor of the future**

Many entrepreneurs fail to accurately predict their growth potential for several reasons:

* **They confuse growth with scalability**: Increasing revenue doesn't necessarily mean building a stronger, more resilient company  
* **They lack predictive indicators**: They rely on metrics that show the past instead of signaling what's about to happen  
* **They don't measure what truly matters**: They overlook crucial indicators like cash velocity and operational efficiency  
* **They ignore internal signals**: They don't pay attention to process standardization and key talent retention

But there's a solution\! You can overcome these challenges by implementing a system of predictive KPIs that will show you exactly where to intervene before it's too late.

Here's how, step by step:

## **Step 1: Monitor the LTV/CAC ratio to verify commercial sustainability**

This ratio is fundamental because it tells you how much value a customer generates compared to how much you spend to acquire them. An LTV/CAC below 3 means you're spending too much to acquire customers who don't generate enough value. Successful entrepreneurs multiply their profitability simply by optimizing this indicator, improving their acquisition strategy.

## **Step 2: Calculate and optimize your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**

Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of ignoring this indicator, thinking it's just an administration problem. The CCC measures how many days pass from when you pay suppliers to when you collect from customers, and a cycle that's too long means the more you grow, the more capital you need. To avoid this trap, you must systematically compare inventory days, receivables days, and payables days, aiming for a CCC below 60 days.

## **Step 3: Also Integrate Gross Margin, Standardized Processes, and Talent Retention**

Here's how to complete the picture of a business's scalability. These three indicators complement the first two, allowing you to build a comprehensive dashboard that predicts your growth potential:

* Variable gross margin tells you how much you earn each time you ship a product,  
* The % of standardized processes indicates how easily you'll avoid a dispute after shipping it  
* Key talent retention tells you how well you'll be able to continue the trend and improve the data in the future.

Controlling this data and seeing it as a whole allows you to face the balance sheet moment with fewer surprises and give the company a more stable direction, less enslaved by market winds.
