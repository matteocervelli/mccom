  Monthly management control makes you discover problems when it’s already too late. On average, financial data arrives with a 15-20 day delay, and you often notice a problem only months after it has occurred. **Do you really want to keep running your company looking in the rearview mirror?** There is a way to anticipate problems and act before they impact your results.
