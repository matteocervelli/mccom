# Master Strategy: Subscriber Tracking & Segmentation (MailerLite + MailerSend)

---

## üìÜ GOAL

Create a reliable and scalable system to:

- Track all meaningful user actions (newsletter signup, tools downloaded, calls booked, email sent/received)
- Maintain language preferences
- Automate custom sequences
- Keep clear, segmented lists for personal weekly newsletters, tools delivery, and conversion tracking

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è TERMINOLOGY USED

- **Field (custom field)** = persistent property of the subscriber (e.g. language, name, client status)
- **Group** = manually or automatically managed tag that shows an action or event (e.g. downloaded tool X, booked a free consultation)
- **Segment** = smart/dynamic group based on field values or group memberships, used for targeting (e.g. all EN speakers who downloaded tool Y)

## üåê LANGUAGE MANAGEMENT

| Label | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `language` | Field | Persistent field (`it`, `en`). Set by the form or QR code source. Used for sending content in the correct language |

### üì¶ TOOL DOWNLOADS (LEAD MAGNETS)

## üîÑ SEGMENTS TO BUILD

| Segment Name | Logic |
|--------------|--------|
| `weekly_newsletter_it` | `language = it` + `group: newsletter_it` |
| `weekly_newsletter_en` | `language = en` + `group: newsletter_en` |
| `tool_x_english_users` | `language = en` + `group: download_toolname_x` |
| `tool_x_italian_clients` | `language = it` + `group: download_toolname_x` + `field: client = yes` |
| `non_clients_engaged` | `field: client = no` + `group in (any tool, any call)` |

---
