Always looking for the why of things, Matteo does not limit himself to observing the surface, but immerses himself directly in the essence of the issues to understand how to improve.</p><p>His attitude towards innovation and change is contagious and inspiring. It&rsquo;s not just about wanting to improve existing processes, but about transforming the entire organizational structure into something beautiful and meaningful. This vision of beauty is not limited to aesthetics, but extends to the beauty of efficient functioning, long-term goal, and the personal and professional growth of the people around him.</p></div><a href=/testimonials/fabrice-pettoello/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Testimonials</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/testimonials/federico-trippi/ class="link black dim">Federico Trippi</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Matteo is a person with vision, who does not give up reading beyond the surface. He loves to dare to set himself challenges that are concrete but at the same time above the line of &ldquo;immediately feasible&rdquo;. This attitude can be viral and also allows the people around him to look beyond the immediately achievable results (often of modest value), to set themselves more ambitious and certainly more satisfying goals.</p></div><a href=/testimonials/federico-trippi/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Testimonials</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/testimonials/filippo-maone/ class="link black dim">Filippo Maone</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Matteo is a guide who accompanies me towards objectives aimed at personal and work improvement.

But the thing that made me grow the most was my attitude to change.
