&lt;p>This website was created by Matteo Cervelli using a mix of personal skills and AI. I previously had a website hosted and built on WordPress, but I decided to rebuild it myself in early 2025 to &amp;ldquo;keep control&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted a lightweight, fast, and responsive website. And I wanted to learn the basics by leveraging what technology has to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, matteocervelli.com is a static website. It&amp;rsquo;s built with &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a> as SSG—Static Site Generator—and is hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify&lt;/a> via &lt;a href="https://github.com">GitHub&lt;/a>, while DNS is managed through &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://matteocervelli.com/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 17:26:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matteocervelli.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="in-short">In short&lt;/h2>
