You can find my thoughts, my writings and how to work with me.</p><p>Ultimately, I work to build businesses that scale, I work with people and through a union of purpose, we are able to build ecosystems that bring beauty.</p><p>There is a thread that unites parenting, education and doing business: triggering talent. Everyone has unexpressed potential and through my work, I strive to ensure that this emerges.</p><p>As a leader, this translates into the continuous search for autonomy of collaborators, an approach that can be adapted to all contexts. Driven by purpose.</p><h2 id=my-main-skills>My main skills</h2><p>My main advantage is that of having operated as CEO of a medium/large company, present in many countries. In addition to speaking many languages, English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, in addition to my mother tongue Italian, I have seen many cultures and learned to sell by going directly to customers&rsquo; homes.</p><p>I have dealt with entrepreneurs and managers of large billion-dollar companies, financed by Private Equity.</p><p>In the company, a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Family Business, I saw M&amp;A, strategy, finance and specialized in change management, a skill, a real method for grounding changes.</p><p>As an Engineer, I build methods, or apply them, to make things more effective. By the way, I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to make processes more repeatable and scalable, exponentially.</p><h2 id=my-background>My background</h2><p>2025 — We launch a new consulting project called <a href=https://adlimen.com>Ad Limen Consulting</a>, specifically aimed at supporting business scalability.</p><p>2024 — In July I leave the management of <a href=https://www.urania.group>Urania Group</a>, I remain a partner.

And I move, as CEO, to restructure the Serrall company, in Umbria, which went through an M&amp;A operation.</p><p>2016 — After a period as Innovation Manager, I moved to the PanHouse project where, as PM, we rebuilt the New School of Cittareale, which was destroyed in the summer earthquake, in just 19 days of construction.</p><p>2015 — I completed my Master&rsquo;s Degree in <a href=https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english/course/10275>Management Engineering</a>—<em>Ingegneria Gestionale</em> in italian— in Pisa with 110 cum laude.</p><p>2014 — I get married to Sara.
