      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a villain. I got acquainted with mine five years ago in a meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a hot summer day, and I was presenting a quarter update about a company we recently acquired. We couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I was showing a PowerPoint filled with data and insights. Suddenly, Mr. Bowser started giving his own vision of the world, not caring about the information I provided. It was like all the job I did with my team was not real, while it was succumbing under a machine gun that fires repeated shots full of convictions taken from who knows what life experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders of great organizations focus all efforts on finding their successors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most successful bosses don’t micromanage. Instead, they help people to have greater responsibility. And to make this, the leader’s role change from a problem solver to a people enabler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, micro-management has bad side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bureaucracy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Less time spent on long term success&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The company don’t resist over the actual leader&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is what great leaders do, instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
