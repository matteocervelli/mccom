                "content": "Context In August 2016, earthquakes shook middle Italy in Amatrice and Norcia. Italy has always been a country with seismic activity, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have the same building culture as Japan or Taiwan.\nThe devastating impact of the earthquake on local communities \u0026times; \u0026lt; \u0026gt; The event devastated small villages, some of them also famous for tourism, like Norcia, the hometown of Saint Benedict, or Amatrice, well known for an Italian sauce for pasta called Amatriciana, which combines tomato, pig\u0026rsquo;s cheek, and pecorino for a divine taste.\nBy early September, as Urania Group, we were involved in conversations with humanitarian associations, who were interested in our PanHouse+ system. We could deliver high-performance, permanent buildings very quickly.\nCittareale, a small mountain community of just over 400 inhabitants Our project was built in a tiny village of Cittareale, a small community of just over 400 inhabitants scattered in the mountains.\nChallenge The main challenge was to provide a permanent, safe educational facility for the community in the shortest possible time, while ensuring the highest quality and safety standards in a seismically active area.\nSolution I took the project\u0026rsquo;s lead, utilizing tools like Microsoft Project and our ERP to verify all constraints and manage the complex logistics. The project required constant travel to Cittareale (a 4-hour trip one way) and close coordination with local stakeholders.\nThe rapid construction progress of the school building During the construction, we experienced another significant earthquake on October 30th, 2016, which reinforced the importance of our mission and the need for seismic-resistant structures.\nLiving on site: our temporary home during the final construction phase Results Completed the 260-square-meter school building in just 19 days Created the first permanent building after the Amatrice earthquake Provided a safe, modern educational facility for the local community Demonstrated the effectiveness of prefabricated construction in post-disaster recovery Insights This project was more than just construction - it was about community resilience and hope. Living among these people for a month, who were attending school in a tent, we personally understood how education is the fulcrum for building a better future and overcoming adversity.\nLu Ceppe: where we found warmth and hospitality during our stay The experience taught us valuable lessons about:\nThe importance of rapid response in crisis situations The power of prefabricated construction in emergency scenarios The role of education infrastructure in community recovery The human aspect of construction projects The completed school: a symbol of renewal and resilience for the community The school became a symbol of renewal and resilience for the community, acting as a catalyst for the scattered mountain community\u0026rsquo;s recovery following the earthquake.\n",

                "title": "37, The Year of Descent",
                "content": "37, the year of descent.\nToday I blow out 37 candles.\nThis has been the most intense, challenging, and meaningful year of my life.\nIf I had to choose one word that best characterizes this year, I choose descent.\nIt was a year in which I chose to descend. I would have liked to climb back up too, but it feels good to be down as well. And the bottom never ends - the bottom of frustration, the bottom of repressed anger, the bottom of shame, and the bottom of others\u0026rsquo; judgment.\nThis year, I learned to choose. I learned to modulate emotions too big to keep inside yet too painful to express. And sometimes I expressed them, perhaps too often for others, and too little for myself.\nWhen you go down, you learn to see others\u0026rsquo; suffering, to understand what true wealth is. Yet, I still feel too full of myself to distinguish well.\nIn these words, I therefore want to gather what this year has brought me. I write it for myself, but I make it public in case there might be even just one person who would like to know something about this year where I changed quite a bit and about the motivations that drive me.\nFebruary 21, 2024 A rather bizarre group of people enters the Covered Market of Ravenna. Apparently, in the evening, the stalls close and only restaurants remain open, so it\u0026rsquo;s my birthday and we decide to stop and eat at a large table in the center of the building, eating fish. The fish is excellent, but maneuvering between two dogs, 2 young daughters, and a mother in a wheelchair isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly easy.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t digest well Emma\u0026rsquo;s tantrums about wanting a piadina at the restaurant, and fortunately finding the piadina restaurant open at the covered market. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the wine much, I enjoyed the food little, albeit excellent, and the wonderful atmosphere.\nThe birthday dinner at the Covered Market of Ravenna A moment of reflection on the Ravenna beach I will carry with me the memories of these two days of madness, taking mom to Ravenna with my family, to let her taste the life of a family too bizarre to describe.\nBut these days made my pain explode, a pain I had been carrying inside and that wasn\u0026rsquo;t letting me think clearly, so much that at one point I went into complete shutdown, sitting on a concrete barrier in Piazza del Popolo, while the world around went on and I was in some sort of trance. With Sara holding two dogs that could easily pull Santa\u0026rsquo;s sleigh, with the girls watching, and with my mother suffering from my same pain.\nI still didn\u0026rsquo;t know what would happen and how I would heal my suffering, but that day I understood that I had to do something.\nSpring Air and Cleaning Closets It\u0026rsquo;s in the following spring that the most important event of my life, both professional and personal, manifests itself. In April, I announce to my uncle, the main partner of the family business where I was also CEO of one of the companies, my willingness to \u0026ldquo;make myself available,\u0026rdquo; meaning to resign from my position and leave it in their hands to decide. And immediately after, that I had understood I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go back on this decision.\nThere are many reasons for this choice, where that hint of depression I was falling into, or maybe it was just heavy burnout, and which I had started to treat, certainly represents the engine for action.\nI gave a lot and learned a lot in these 10 years of working in the family business. A high-level company that existed before me and will exist after, because it has a valid product and solid leadership. In that same company where I tried to build my story, and that at the same time tried to modify my essence, making me believe I wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough. That I wasn\u0026rsquo;t what I should have been. Surely, this suffering is mine alone, in the sense that only I can feel a mix between family affection, professional commitment, and desire to build something that goes beyond centuries, so much as to suffer so much. Probably what I feel could be contradicted and explained in many ways, I was used to receiving many, generous, frequent, gratuitous explanations.\nBut when the company must go through profound changes, I, who teach change management, know that first of all, you need to create a strong coalition. And nothing makes a coalition stronger than having to face a change at the top. This is the main reason why, by mutual agreement, we decided that a sacrifice was necessary to take a decisive step in one direction or another.\nDuring spring, my role changed from Chief Executive Officer to Equity Partner. I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a better name to define my being a partner, finally, albeit without any privilege, a role I had pursued for many years and that was met with such indifference by the social structure that it made me understand that in all this I would always be the indigestible organ that was annoying. And not even perceived as valuable.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where the vase broke, in a meeting room more worried than decided, in congratulations never arrived and in the sense of loss that family vicissitudes would give us in the following months. Because our family has suffered silent pain, shouted and silent again. It has suffered the end of a life that has fought the waltz of life for a long time and right there, in that suffering, fundamental values emerged. Like using critical thinking, like building reasoning on data, and like managing with a look at evolution and one at concreteness. I haven\u0026rsquo;t accepted derision, I haven\u0026rsquo;t accepted pruning. Or I swallowed it and it allowed me to start over.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s in this precarious situation that just 3 days after that moment on the barrier in Ravenna, we discover that we\u0026rsquo;re expecting, again, a child. It\u0026rsquo;s a spark I can\u0026rsquo;t forget, and a compass for the decisions I made afterwards.\nAs the sole source of income for the family, with a certainly not flourishing situation, on March 26th I open my VAT number. And I cross off one of my life\u0026rsquo;s goals. I had always thought of managing the two worlds together, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be and so I push in the direction of the new reality: consulting. I move to the other side of the barricade, as one of the new and important people I met this year will tell me. I choose to become self-employed for flexibility. Going to work elsewhere, continuing to be the person who comes from outside to fix companies after many years, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have cured my illness, so I refuse some proposals and decide to reset everything.\nI make a list of people who would help me and ask to leave a testimonial, I tell in advance what I would do and I feel listening and curiosity. I get a sort of fizzy will to feel the push I receive, people who appreciate me for what they have known. And at the same time, I hear a voice pulling me by the jacket, telling me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t achieved anything and that they surely only see the good part but not how incompetent I am.\nI\u0026rsquo;m afraid. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of the deep darkness of the soul, the fear of the father who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know if he can guarantee bread for his family.\nI have to start over, but I\u0026rsquo;m afraid.\nBeyond the Threshold Many months have passed since those moments, months that lasted more than a year in my spirit, months that have taught me many things.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s today that with this message I launch a new brand and make public the journey, an aspect I avoided doing for a long time for fear of showing myself too fragile.\nToday begins the era of Ad Limen Consulting, the new consulting project I developed four-handed with a friend I was fortunate to cross paths with years ago, Alexia.\nAd limen means \u0026ldquo;towards the threshold\u0026rdquo;. The complete name would be Ex limine, ad limen. Our \u0026ldquo;Ad\u0026rdquo; tells of crossing a new threshold. The threshold is a symbol that has remained very present in our professional history. The threshold of knowledge, an invisible limit that often doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to understand the limit of what is true and what our brain \u0026ldquo;shows\u0026rdquo; us as true. The threshold understood as an obstacle to overcome, to mean all those obstacles that limit the company\u0026rsquo;s growth that need to be resolved or managed, aiming to choose and understand those truly important. The threshold at which a company plateaus. So we push it from one threshold towards and through a new threshold, scalable.\nAnd I waited so long because I wanted a brand, I wanted websites where to tell the brand\u0026rsquo;s story.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why today I officially launch the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; matteocervelli.com, which is my space and my blog, finally in Italian after many years of English only. A new newsletter is born with this message, in Italian and English, which will find space on the site and with which I want to tell after having made public the transition.\nAnd I launch adlimen.com, the site where we will convey our knowledge base and our services and products. The adlimen site is still in an embryonic state, but at least whoever reads my professional email and wants to snoop around will find something existing.\nAnd these sites represent a rebirth. Because I wrote them myself, from scratch, in every single page and code. To know how I did it, you can explore this page and to know how I use AI, you can read this page.\nI\u0026rsquo;m rewriting the old articles in English, slowly, and they will come back to light, translated, in the coming weeks.\nWhat I Learned, What Comes This year I learned to have courage. Courage to decide and move without having a ready parachute, the courage to descend and face judgment without defenses.\nI learned how difficult it is to stand alone. Alone is ugly. But it\u0026rsquo;s also freedom to choose every day. I missed the emails from collaborators, which in dark moments gave me meaning, urgency, and action and which probably kept me together with tape for longer than I understood.\nI opened a VAT number, and I experienced what precariousness means. Taxes to pay and managing fragile accounts. In this, I found great help in trusting not the usual circle, but a partner like Fiscozen who at a spectacular price gave me a platform to manage my simplified VAT number saving me lots of time, with continuous consultations and alleviating complexity. Small advertisement they deserve, really. In my life as a consultant, I learned to live with a different frustration. And it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful when trust is granted and projects start. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, this is my invitation link.\nI left my family\u0026rsquo;s company. A medium-large company with much to build. I learned how family relationships change in front of a family that revolves around a business, I heard important words and changed roles. And despite everything, I think I can say lucidly that I\u0026rsquo;m fortunate to live in this family that has known how to lick its wounds with great transparency. A big thank you in this I must make to my uncle who showed great stoicism and from whom I can say I have been able to learn and observe and it\u0026rsquo;s a privilege.\nI did psychological therapy and understood it wasn\u0026rsquo;t nonsense. I did it especially thanks to Serenis, which allowed me to choose, gave me a wonderful platform and led me to Francesca, my psychotherapist who taught me so much about my relationships, made me see and if today I stand on my feet it\u0026rsquo;s thanks to her patience and her scientific approach. In the link you find my invitation, which gives you two free sessions. Everyone has something to tell and needs someone who listens. Psychology is incredible, try it.\nI learned to use artificial intelligence, I went deep and found my way. If you\u0026rsquo;re not using it yet, you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re missing and you\u0026rsquo;re no longer up to date. For sure. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I use it in this blog. And other things will come. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\nI invested in a company and organized events, like those of the Business Angel Club in Pisa. Now I am Matteo Cervelli, engineer and consultant for business scalability. I also gave meaning to my Engineer title. And I learned to manage money, to invest. In this, I must give great credit, among many sources, to Giorgio\u0026rsquo;s channel, alias Mr. RIP who helped me understand many things.\nI learned to better distinguish the nonsense that is said, the competencies that aren\u0026rsquo;t there, and empty models. I met a long list of people, some valuable, others less so who in the end helped me understand that I\u0026rsquo;m not really the stupidest of all and that my mission and what I believe in have value. Critical thinking and doubt were my medicines. Without this leap into the void, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have really understood.\nI organized many training sessions and lessons and here too I understood that academic knowledge, deep knowledge, is worth much more than what the social media wave wants us to believe. Invest, always, in deep knowledge. Do research, doubt, discover the causes and go deep.\nAnd in an era of great changes and a crazy geopolitical situation, with leaders who go to shoot propaganda and hide from criticism with absolutist behavior, I understood that the only absolute that has the power to guide me and that I need is God. In him I trust. We met again. Or rather, I returned to listening to him in my heart. And he is my consolation.\nWhat Matters In this year of change, the strongest thing is that I had the privilege of being a father again, from the start, and of experiencing my daughter that I didn\u0026rsquo;t experience (Covid aside) Emma and Maria. Anna was the greatest gift I could have in this year, because in her simple presence everything becomes light. Emma, Maria and Anna are light. A light that sometimes dims and I apologize to them for all the ugly they have seen of me. For the stomach aches I gave them, for the times they saw me cry and not get up, leaning on the furniture in the kitchen or on the floor like a capricious child.\nThey supported me with their differences, because they gave me rhythm. They made me think I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to be a father and in this I learned that one isn\u0026rsquo;t a parent by competence, but only thanks to the relationship that binds us every day, that grows, evolves.\nEmma turned 6, and for the first time I felt the weight of time. She will go to school and I already feel she\u0026rsquo;s no longer \u0026ldquo;mine\u0026rdquo;, I don\u0026rsquo;t control her. The same will happen, God willing, with Maria and Anna.\nAnd I love them, with all my heart. And I hope I can be a father for them.\nIn this year I experienced the tragedy of my mom\u0026rsquo;s illness. A tragedy that starts from far away, or perhaps from too close, in time. I experienced the rejection she experienced, the difficulty of being yourself, friends who forget you. And those who stay. I experienced how many can\u0026rsquo;t talk to a person who can\u0026rsquo;t talk and tell you this as a justification. I understand them, because one is naked in front of illness.\nBut illness is a personal thing, a backwash of terror that grows inside you, always being with the fear of the end, of a story that can\u0026rsquo;t be beautiful again. But only because beautiful is what we define as such. Because in this illness I understood that the only life worth living is that of descent, of the Cross. Even if God didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, something I find difficult to doubt, even in that case the best life to live would be that of mockery, of judgment, of the look of superiority, of forgetting yourself. Because it\u0026rsquo;s down there at the bottom that we can discover our brother\u0026rsquo;s needs. And make ourselves servants, disciples of Love, the only true engine that gathers us in its arms and accompanies us towards True Joy.\nGod give me the Cross and help me carry it.\nI rediscovered in my mom\u0026rsquo;s illness what it means to be a son. What it means to feel dull pain and the value of time. And I hope I can be a shoulder for her, in a new relationship where sometimes I am father to her who has been mother to me. There is a strong light in the darkness, in the temptation to give up everything and believe that the devil dominates the world. And he does, it\u0026rsquo;s His world, because our world is hidden. The essential lies in the heart of the relationship, of feeling unique. And I feel unique. For my mom, I am unique in the world.\nI am for her, I am for my daughters.\nAnd I am for my wife. She who is the beginning and end of my story. In her whom I chose to bind my existence to 10 years ago (anniversary also of this year) and whom I pray that the Lord grants me as wife for eternity. The love that devours, that consumes. That has consumed our relationship with many breaking points, and that teaches us the ability to bend and always start over, to rebuild, to tell each other the secrets of the heart and to be there. As friends. As lovers. As beloved. Unique, together, in God.\nSara, I love you and everything good that my life gives me comes with you who have supported me. In everything, this year I learned the most important lesson. That you are breath of life for me, and that all I really need is your love. Imperfect and fragile, but that draws source from the Love of he who chose us before ourselves.\nMay our love preserve us.\nMay our love be beauty, beauty that changes the world and makes it a better place.\nMatteo and Sara ",

Therefore, it may happen that one of the two languages presents verbal forms generated by an LLM that I haven\u0026rsquo;t completely rewritten, especially in older articles predating February 15, 2025, when I published the new version of the site on Netlify.\nAlthough I speak English fluently, I normally use revision systems for logical errors, and lately, my preferred tool is LanguageTool.\nI use Claude 3.5 Sonnet as an assistant, mainly for research, to support me with the site development procedures. I occasionally use Perplexity as an alternative search engine to avoid Data Cutoff Dates. I use all the tools somewhat, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok sporadically, out of curiosity and to test their functionalities.\nI use Cursor as a code editor, mainly to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. If ChatGPT was a first taste and Claude was my first true love among LLMs, Cursor has literally changed my life.

                "content": "This blog post collects my takeaway from the book: The Purple Cow by Seth Godin\nThere is nothing but an ingredient to be successful: being a Purple Cow.\nWait, what\u0026rsquo;s a Purple Cow?\nThe Purple Cow is a concept defined by Seth Godin to indicate the extraordinary that allows a business to stand out from the mass and build success. It\u0026rsquo;s not just an advantage.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the necessary choice.\nAnd, unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not enough.\nHaving a Purple Cow enables results. But executing your business to deliver the Purple Cow and defend it from false moos is equally necessary. Or defend it from the false sense of extraordinariness that comes from looking in the mirror, ready to destroy it.\nFinding a Purple Cow is the foundation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how:\n1. Developing an Extraordinary Product The journey to extraordinary begins with the product itself. Imagine if your coffee maker could give you compliments or if your shoes could tell you stories about where they\u0026rsquo;ve been. It\u0026rsquo;s not about adding bells and whistles to an existing offering but reimagining what a product can be. This stage is about innovation at its core, solving problems in ways that have never been considered.\n\u0026ldquo;In a crowded marketplace, fitting in is failing. In a busy marketplace, not standing out is the same as being invisible.\u0026rdquo;\n— Seth Godin, The Purple Cow\nTo develop an extraordinary product, start by identifying the status quo in your industry: What are the accepted norms, and why do they exist? Challenge these norms and ask \u0026ldquo;What if?\u0026rdquo;:\nWhat if you could make a product faster, more durable, or more beautiful? What if you could change the way people interact with it?\nThese questions are the seeds from which your Purple Cow will grow. And remember, if at first you don\u0026rsquo;t succeed, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because you\u0026rsquo;re not wearing your thinking cap - or maybe you just need more coffee.\n2. Finding Your Otaku People Otaku, a Japanese term, here refers to the obsessive interest that some people have in a topic. Your product\u0026rsquo;s success depends on these individuals. They\u0026rsquo;re not just customers; they\u0026rsquo;re passionate advocates for your product. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones who will camp outside your store in a blizzard, just for a sneak peek.\n\u0026ldquo;Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories you tell.\u0026rdquo;\n— Seth Godin, The Purple Cow\nIdentifying your otaku means understanding who is most likely to be passionate about your product. What specific problem does your product solve, and who suffers most from this problem? Once identified, learn everything about them - their habits, their desires, and their communication channels. These insights will guide not just your product development but your entire marketing strategy. And if you find your otaku are into something weird, like collecting pictures of cats dressed as pirates, well, that\u0026rsquo;s just an added bonus for conversation starters.\n3. Creating Initiatives to Present the Product to Your Otaku After building a deep understanding of your otaku, it\u0026rsquo;s time to present them your product. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about broad, sweeping marketing campaigns but targeted, meaningful interactions. Think of it as a first date with your partner\u0026rsquo;s parents, but instead of flowers, you\u0026rsquo;re bringing a prototype.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t find customers for your products, find products for your customers.\u0026rdquo;\n— Seth Godin, The Purple Cow\nCreate experiences that allow your otaku to deeply engage with your product. This could be through exclusive beta testing, community forums, or live interactive events. The goal is to create a memorable, engaging experience that they will want to share. Remember, your otaku are your first and most important marketers. And if all else fails, you can always bribe them with cookies - everyone loves cookies.\n4. Ensuring Sneezers Spread the Word at the Right Time \u0026ldquo;Sneezers,\u0026rdquo; as Godin describes them, will be the first people likely to spread the word about your product. They\u0026rsquo;re a subset of your otaku, the ones who can\u0026rsquo;t wait to tell others about their discoveries. They\u0026rsquo;re like your product\u0026rsquo;s personal cheerleading squad, minus the pom-poms.\n\u0026ldquo;Ideas that spread, win.\u0026rdquo;\n— Seth Godin, The Purple Cow\nTiming is critical. You want Sneezers to start talking when your product is ready to be shared, not before it\u0026rsquo;s fully realized. Coordinate product launches, announcements, and special events to create buzz that sneezes can amplify. Provide them with the tools they need to share easily and widely, through social media, blogs, or forums. And if you can get them to do a synchronized dance about your product, even better.\n5. Facilitating the Probability of Cross-Pollination Cross-pollination here refers to the spread of your product\u0026rsquo;s idea from one group to another. It\u0026rsquo;s the viral effect that every marketer dreams of. It\u0026rsquo;s like telling one person a joke and, by the end of the day, the entire office is laughing.\n\u0026ldquo;The secret to successful sneezing is to be in front of a group that\u0026rsquo;s predisposed to listen.\u0026rdquo; — Seth Godin, The Purple Cow\nTo facilitate this spread, you need to understand the networks your otaku and sneezers inhabit.\nWhat other interests do they have? What other groups do they belong to?\nBy understanding these networks, you can present your product in a way that feels natural and welcome. This might involve partnering with other companies, engaging with influencers, or creating content that\u0026rsquo;s easily shared across different platforms. And remember, the goal is to make your product the next big thing, not the next big meme (unless that\u0026rsquo;s your thing, then meme away!).\nConclusion Creating a Purple Cow is not a one-time act; it\u0026rsquo;s a continuous process of innovation, understanding, engagement, and refinement. It\u0026rsquo;s about creating something truly remarkable and then letting the world know about it: by developing an extraordinary product, finding and engaging with your otaku, ensuring sneezers spread the word at the right time, and facilitating cross-pollination, you\u0026rsquo;re not just building a product. You\u0026rsquo;re building a movement. And possibly a cult following, but let\u0026rsquo;s stick with movement for now. Remember, the Purple Cow is not just a metaphor. It\u0026rsquo;s a call to action. It\u0026rsquo;s a challenge to be daring, to be different, and to be truly remarkable. In the words of Seth Godin, \u0026ldquo;In a world of brown cows, your only chance to score is to not be brown.\u0026rdquo; So, what color will your cow be? Will it be purple, polka-dotted, or maybe even rainbow? The choice is yours, and the pasture is waiting. Now go out there and make some moos - I mean, moves!\n",

Read more about my background to understand how I got here.\nI help companies grow in a scalable way I am a business consultant and advisor.\nMy work consists of helping companies grow in a scalable way through Strategy, Change Management, Sales and Business Development, Leadership Training and Coaching.\nMany of my entrepreneur friends have noticed that I\u0026rsquo;ve switched to the other side of the fence. My strength lies precisely in combining my experience as a family business partner + medium/large company management + international sales with my skills as a Scalability Engineer.\nYet I believe in the power of ecosystems and the need to do holistic and fractal work together to grow the country\u0026rsquo;s system.\nMy working model is based on 3 phases: assessment, sprint project (with implementation), and follow-up with advisory.\nTo hire me and get in touch, visit the Work page.\nFamily Man I live with my beautiful wife Sara and our 3 daughters, two dogs, in our beautiful house in the countryside. And I live close to my parents to help and support them through my mother\u0026rsquo;s illness. Maybe not the kind of update you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a Now page, but it\u0026rsquo;s reality.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve Restarted my Blog I\u0026rsquo;ve been writing on this blog for a few years, but I recently changed my approach. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand WordPress anymore and decided to start fresh with Hugo and Netlify. I talk about it here. Hopefully, this will also revitalize my social media management.\nMaster\u0026rsquo;s Program Professor I teach in two Master\u0026rsquo;s programs at the University of Pisa: Master in Scalability \u0026amp; Business Growth \u0026mdash; dedicated to scalable business growth \u0026mdash; and Master Industry 5.0 \u0026mdash; on digital and sustainable industry transformation, focusing on enabling technologies.\nTeaching is hard, it requires a lot of preparation work and you always worry that you\u0026rsquo;re not meeting expectations. But I love it because when I finish a session I\u0026rsquo;m still full of adrenaline; and they say I do it well.\nBusiness Angel I collaborate with the Pisa Business Angel Club and invest in startups.

                "title": "The Tightrope Walker Manager: Mastering Leadership's Balancing Act",
                "content": "It takes 20 years to build a new manager. 20 years where those responsible for delegating constantly oscillate on the edge of anxiety.\nThe risk behind delegation Like tightrope walkers, managers swing between the fear of being surpassed by people who might have something more than them and the risk that their team will lose drive and, ultimately, competitiveness by relying on inadequate people. Leaders who take the path of delegation risk falling painfully. But those who make it and get to the end receive applause from the audience—the same audience that lives in constant expectation of the fatal misstep.\nIt takes 20 years, and faced with such a long period, which is half of a person\u0026rsquo;s working life, we understand how important it is to keep collaborators with us. It\u0026rsquo;s a patience that can be very costly. Sometimes managers in training are tempted to leave. When people want to leave, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for them to perform at 100%.\nI once heard an entrepreneur say, \u0026ldquo;These young people deceive us, maybe they\u0026rsquo;re good, we invest in them and then they abandon us.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd if we use money as leverage to make them stay, as entrepreneurs we show everyone that the value system on which we base the company is poor.\nBees and Gardeners I believe in open systems, I believe in learning how to attract people who also have different backgrounds but are drawn to values, perhaps at a specific moment in their life trajectory.\nIn a company, there are bees and gardeners. There\u0026rsquo;s no point in forcing heroes to be farmers and vice versa; the company must be able to manage both.\nA company must aim to keep the bees moving to spread pollen and cross-pollinate.\nAt the same time, we must preserve the gardeners, who year after year grow people, prune them, and make them bloom again.\nTherefore, to grow the company, we need gardeners who cultivate people. To grow people, you need stimuli that trigger growth.\nThese incentives fail in a company that doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s face reality: on one side, the fear of losing people we\u0026rsquo;ve invested so much in and who have the power to grow others; on the other, the difficulty of giving these people continuous stimulation without losing power and control.\nThe challenge of growth Power for the manager vs. emerging talent.\nIn this apparent dualism, leadership stories have played out since the dawn of humanity, and it\u0026rsquo;s only by resolving it that the best stories continue.\nTo resolve it, there\u0026rsquo;s only one way: find a challenge and grow toward it, solving obstacles one at a time. Growth is the only, forced path. In growth, there\u0026rsquo;s space for everyone.\nThe tightrope walker knows that to learn, you must walk on the same rope that can lead to oblivion. Every step is a risk.\nEnough is the enemy Walking the tightrope means aiming to improve 1% each day, which will allow us to accumulate significant growth in 20 years. Growing by 1% every week means improving 40 thousand times in 20 years of your career.\nUnfortunately, this growth path is often precluded to entrepreneurs who cannot renew themselves due to the inability to see the future as an ally. The enterprise is born behind a dream of \u0026ldquo;abundance,\u0026rdquo; but often the dream is set aside for the enemy of \u0026ldquo;enough.\u0026rdquo;\nSeeing \u0026ldquo;enough success\u0026rdquo; as an outcome makes one give up, waver, and settle. Those who have had enough success are more afraid of making mistakes, staying rooted in the experience of what they\u0026rsquo;ve gathered, like a parasitic plant clinging to a trunk. They won\u0026rsquo;t have their own form and won\u0026rsquo;t act like a gardener who needs to prune to make space for new shoots and new paths.\nIt takes 20 years to grow a manager. To avoid finding ourselves having wasted time after 20 years, we need daily steps to break out of the equilibrium we\u0026rsquo;ve achieved.\nFeatured image by Loic Leray on Unsplash\n",

                "title": "Find Your Villain, Learn Your Mission",
                "content": "Everyone has a villain. I got acquainted with mine five years ago in a meeting room.\nIt was a hot summer day, and I was presenting a quarter update about a company we recently acquired. We couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I was showing a PowerPoint filled with data and insights. Suddenly, Mr. Bowser started giving his own vision of the world, not caring about the information I provided. It was like all the job I did with my team was not real, while it was succumbing under a machine gun that fires repeated shots full of convictions taken from who knows what life experience.\nWell, this is normal. I mean, critics are the fertilizer for growth. But, believe me, I don’t know if it was for the meeting room hotter than a jalapeño in a taqueria de chiles, but I felt completely blown up. Like a complete idiot, I started ranting about the motivations that made me reach certain conclusions.\nI can’t recall too much about the reaction at the table, and I remember people looking at me like you look at a touchy person ranting absurd words to justify his beliefs.\nFor the first time in my life, my lungs were struggling to pump in and out breaths to make me stay alive, a sensation I was just starting to know.\nIt is common for people to hold opposing opinions of one another.\nHave you ever noticed those people who enter a conversation like they are on a mission to find any speck of diversity, only to react with utter conformity to it? They’re like those picky eaters who claim to love trying new food, but they end up sticking to their plain old cheeseburger every time. And it’s because diverse opinions and perspectives make them uncomfortable.\nThis is how Mr. Bowser was acting, but I didn’t realize that I vibrated more and more often when I encountered similar reactions from people.\nIt took me time, but finally, years later, I saw the deep ruts that Mr. Bowser dug in my soul. At the time, I counter-react in the same way: I was on a mission to save my Princess Peach (this is the moment when gaming people must have understood that Mr. Bowser is just a pseudonym) and defeat my villain. My actions were motivated by destruction, not creativity.\nSomething clicked when I saw the pattern.\nWhether you believe it or not, we are the expressions of others’ missed expectations, the strange faces they make. It is always our reaction to events that shapes our way of doing things.\nWe are continuously stimulated by the faces, reactions and comments that are the feedback we get. But while the thinking process is hidden behind the neocortex, often also to us, the action we take at the moment after is the public image we create for ourselves. Then an action becomes a habit,- while in a vicious circle, people react to our ways. And we are done.\nAnd here is the revelation: what brings us a sense of mission is not what we would like to do but the reaction to how the environment has molded us.\nTeaching moment: What is a mission? A mission is a purpose or cause that deeply motivates people to take meaningful actions based on their values and interests. \u0026gt;\nMy mission is to empower other talents to focus more on creativity and less on destruction. I define this state as Beautyvision—a state in which creativity is freed from the chains of conformity, and people are empowered with a vision of building instead of destroying.\nI coined my mission back in 2019, a few months after the event took place. But at the time I was not capable of understanding the connection.\nMy reaction to Mr. Bowser\u0026rsquo;s criticism shaped me as a touchy person who desired to destroy whatever he was saying. At the same time, I split up into halves, and it became my mission.\nIt took five years. That day I was conversing with my psychotherapist about the causes behind my burnout, and she realized a dualism between my reactions to Mr. Bowser and my happiness while speaking about my mission. Simply as it is, she pulled the trigger: “So you want to do the contrary of the deactivation you received for your diversity, you want to elevate others’ talent rather than sink them down to a useless, easy level.”I giggled.\nShe was right.\nAt the end of the day, this made me question whether I was simply a product of that moment or if I was more than that.\nAfter delving deeper into introspection, I understood that while external influences shape us, they do not solely define who we are. Imagine our souls being like cymbals that clang not only when struck by the mallets that activate their resonance but also when surrounded by the negative reverberations of challenging experiences.\nHere’s another example: imagine people facing repeated setbacks in their careers. While these troubles influence their outlook, they do not mold who they are. Instead, their resilience and core values come into play, shaping how they navigate and ultimately transcend these challenges.\nBasically, even though external factors have a big say in our lives, they do not have the power to entirely sculpt the essence of who we are. Our souls resonate with a unique vibration that encompasses both external influences and intrinsic qualities, shaping the bronze that we present to the world.\nIn conclusion, my personal observation about how to find your mission:\nTo learn your mission, find your villain first.\nWe often think that our mission is something we must discover by digging deep into our souls, but the truth is: that it\u0026rsquo;s right in front of us, disguised as our villain. And this leads us to see that the villain is not only something to fear but to embrace. It hurts, but it’s the first step to using the lessons you learn to fuel your missions.\nIt is faster, easier, and utterly more effective than looking into yourself.\nIt helped me to see and to take action, to build on the bad moments. Your mission creates a positive impact: find your villain, discover the purpose and dedicate your life to forge the best possible world where it is worth to live in, for you and for who cames next.\nCover image by BRICK 101 on flickr\n",

Here is a guide to learn how to be a person whom everyone talk to with joy.\nEmpathy classification According to Kendra Cherry, there are three kinds of empathy:\nAffective empathy involves understanding another person\u0026rsquo;s emotions and responding appropriately. Somatic empathy involves a physical mirroring of the feelings of the other. Cognitive empathy involves understanding another person\u0026rsquo;s mental state. Empathy is a trainable skill People think that empathy is an innate capacity. They are wrong. Everyone can train it.\nEmpathy involves the skill of listening to what the other is saying and taking care of the other\u0026rsquo;s feelings outside your perspective.\nTheresa Wiseman identifies four attributes of Empathy:\nPerspective-taking Staying out of judgment Recognizing emotion in others Communicating back the feeling you see Graphic by the author\nThe Skills of Empathy When you approach Empathy, you must avoid problem-solving. Or telling. Empathy involves the rough acceptance of others\u0026rsquo; feelings. The fact is you can\u0026rsquo;t help people by changing their feelings.\nTo build your empathy skills, you can:\nListen to people without interrupting Pay attention to body language Don\u0026rsquo;t focus whether you agree or not with people Ask people deepening questions to understand their perspective Connect with moments in your life when you felt similar feelings Avoid minimization such as \u0026ldquo;Well, I know that it feels bad, but at least.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t digress to other subjects An Easier Approach to Empathy: Active Listening Active Listening is the foundational skill for empathy\nActive Listening provides the framework to develop a tool kit for empathy. It is a sequential process with four main steps.\nPassive listening (Silence) Opening (Warm invites) Verification of understanding (IIUC) Reflective Listening (paraphrase) Graphic by the author\nStep 1: Passive listening Passive listening means being silent and listening.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t understand another\u0026rsquo;s perspective without practicing silence.\nBut you must avoid prolonged passive listening.\nCommunication is an exchange and not reception of information. Try to imagine going to the doctor, only you speak, and he does not ask you anything looking at you in silence.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it weird?\nStep 2: Opening Help the other to open up and go deeper. Drive verbal and non-verbal messages that make it clear that you are listening.\nThose warm invites are an encouragement to continue. You can use words that emphasize what is said: \u0026rsquo;tell me, \u0026lsquo;I understand\u0026rsquo; but nods, smiles, and looks.\nStep 3: Verification of Understanding It\u0026rsquo;s time to activate. You can ask questions to clarify what you understood. Repeat what you listened to creates a trusted connection. It lets you check if you understand what you are being told. But you must act wisely: you are a scientist, and you use your superpower:\nFalsification.\nA scientific experiment removes progressively any reasonable doubt. It involves:\nBeing patient Conclusions are ephemeral. Forget your point of view. Assume the other is right and ask for help to get his perspective. I have good news for you, there is an easy superpower.\nIIUC, aka \u0026ldquo;If I Understand Correctly\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;If I Understand Correctly\u0026rdquo; are the words to break every barrier.\nIF These two letters are compelling because they instill doubt. It opens the way to an answer where the interlocutor\u0026rsquo;s opinion counts. Questioning shows you are fragile, the most incredible trust that exists.\nI \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t talk about you. The problem is me!\u0026rdquo;. It is a natural sedative: \u0026ldquo;Hey, sorry, help me! Help me understand better what you just said\u0026rdquo;.\nUNDERSTAND You reveal that you want to understand.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, what interests me is to understand your point of view better. Nothing else. Let me understand you better.\u0026rdquo;\nCORRECTLY Here you are trying to clarify the content better.\nYou show good intentions to see if your understanding is correct.\nYour goal is clarity. We left the judgment to others.\nAfter starting with \u0026ldquo;If I understand correctly ..:\u0026rdquo; you can sincerely help the other clarify their thoughts, emotions, and needs behind the message.\nStep 4: Reflective Listening Eventually, you create reflections on what has been said.\nHere is the tipping point.\nDr. Carl Rogers believed that a therapist could best determine the client\u0026rsquo;s needs by listening intently. You go over the pure mirroring, and you reframe the message.\nReflective listening involves empathic paraphrasing. Using the exact words is helpful if you talk about facts and behaviors.\nIf you want to understand a person, it is best to paraphrase when he talks about thoughts, feelings, and desires. In these circumstances, people often speak using a very personal vocabulary. What is important to underline is that judgment and problem-solving are excluded from this listening mode.\nEmphatic paraphrasing tips:\nListen for key thoughts, feelings, and statements of facts. Use your own words to let the other person know what you think they meant. Be brief — you are trying to summarize key things said, not a word-for-word account. Avoid interpreting or jumping too far ahead of what the person has said. Conclusions Here are the main takeaways:\nEmpathy is feeling with people from their perspective. The good news is empathy is trainable. Active listening is the more effortless foundational skill to train empathy. Active listening has four steps: passive listening, opening, understanding of comprehension, reflective listening. \u0026ldquo;If I Understand Correctly:…\u0026rdquo; opens the door to effective listening. Be aware: being emphatic is a long life journey. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to travel along with others or it will be only an empty technique. Have a good listening.\nCover Picture by Matheus Ferrero on Unsplash\nDefinition by Dr. Thomas Gordon, an American clinical psychologist, who invented the Parent Effectiveness Parent, a skill program for parents.

The takeaway is that their leaders are not only focused on achieving results. Indeed, they observe the brutal facts and act accordingly.\nWhy?\nBecause it is the best way to help the next-in-line leaders.\nLeadership is learning not on processes but people Great leaders are probably the smartest people in the room.\nYet, this is only an outcome of their scientific investigation. Instead, they focus on value creation. Eliminating waste is their mission.\nThey don’t do it alone, but they foster others’ engagement.\nHow?\nOutstanding leaders make propelling questions to help associates’ self-learning.\nThe organizations evolve through challenges won by people Great leaders drop impossible challenges.\nAnd their associates reach them.\nThat is why it is vital to work with people and elevate their confidence. In great organizations, you expect people to be excited about challenges. The final consideration is that great organizations don’t believe people are a treasure.\nGreat people are.\nAnd they help them to change the world.\nJames C. Collins (born 1958) is an American researcher, author, speaker and consultant focused on the subject of business management and company sustainability and growth.
