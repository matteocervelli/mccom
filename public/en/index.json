Cursor has completely changed my life, while Claude is the best possible learning assistant.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s only thanks to them that a WordPress XML export was enough to have the entire site in Markdown, organized by folders, through a Python Script.\nToday, I write my texts in Markdown, in multiple languages, through Obsidian where I\u0026rsquo;ve built the site structure, and then I build them via Terminal (directly in Cursor) on the Hugo folder. For someone coming from a closed CMS system, having everything on my PC is incredibly liberating. Obviously, with continuous backup to Cloud and NAS.\nThe theme is based on Ananke, where I made personal modifications to both style and structure.\nThe color palette used is:\nMC Purple: #AF00BF MC Peach Light: #FFE8D1 MC Black: #303030 The Fonts are two of my companions:\nRaleway for headings Lora for text Other tools I use to manage the site and my personal activity:\nGoogle Workspace for managing Email and digital Drive, plus documentation.

                "title": "Find Your Villain, Learn Your Mission",
                "content": "Everyone has a villain. I got acquainted with mine five years ago in a meeting room.\nIt was a hot summer day, and I was presenting a quarter update about a company we recently acquired. We couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I was showing a PowerPoint filled with data and insights. Suddenly, Mr. Bowser started giving his own vision of the world, not caring about the information I provided. It was like all the job I did with my team was not real, while it was succumbing under a machine gun that fires repeated shots full of convictions taken from who knows what life experience.\nWell, this is normal. I mean, critics are the fertilizer for growth. But, believe me, I don’t know if it was for the meeting room hotter than a jalapeño in a taqueria de chiles, but I felt completely blown up. Like a complete idiot, I started ranting about the motivations that made me reach certain conclusions.\nI can’t recall too much about the reaction at the table, and I remember people looking at me like you look at a touchy person ranting absurd words to justify his beliefs.\nFor the first time in my life, my lungs were struggling to pump in and out breaths to make me stay alive, a sensation I was just starting to know.\nIt is common for people to hold opposing opinions of one another.\nHave you ever noticed those people who enter a conversation like they are on a mission to find any speck of diversity, only to react with utter conformity to it? They’re like those picky eaters who claim to love trying new food, but they end up sticking to their plain old cheeseburger every time. And it’s because diverse opinions and perspectives make them uncomfortable.\nThis is how Mr. Bowser was acting, but I didn’t realize that I vibrated more and more often when I encountered similar reactions from people.\nIt took me time, but finally, years later, I saw the deep ruts that Mr. Bowser dug in my soul. At the time, I counter-react in the same way: I was on a mission to save my Princess Peach (this is the moment when gaming people must have understood that Mr. Bowser is just a pseudonym) and defeat my villain. My actions were motivated by destruction, not creativity.\nSomething clicked when I saw the pattern.\nWhether you believe it or not, we are the expressions of others’ missed expectations, the strange faces they make. It is always our reaction to events that shapes our way of doing things.\nWe are continuously stimulated by the faces, reactions and comments that are the feedback we get. But while the thinking process is hidden behind the neocortex, often also to us, the action we take at the moment after is the public image we create for ourselves. Then an action becomes a habit,- while in a vicious circle, people react to our ways. And we are done.\nAnd here is the revelation: what brings us a sense of mission is not what we would like to do but the reaction to how the environment has molded us.\nTeaching moment: What is a mission? A mission is a purpose or cause that deeply motivates people to take meaningful actions based on their values and interests. \u0026gt;\nMy mission is to empower other talents to focus more on creativity and less on destruction. I define this state as Beautyvision—a state in which creativity is freed from the chains of conformity, and people are empowered with a vision of building instead of destroying.\nI coined my mission back in 2019, a few months after the event took place. But at the time I was not capable of understanding the connection.\nMy reaction to Mr. Bowser\u0026rsquo;s criticism shaped me as a touchy person who desired to destroy whatever he was saying. At the same time, I split up into halves, and it became my mission.\nIt took five years. That day I was conversing with my psychotherapist about the causes behind my burnout, and she realized a dualism between my reactions to Mr. Bowser and my happiness while speaking about my mission. Simply as it is, she pulled the trigger: “So you want to do the contrary of the deactivation you received for your diversity, you want to elevate others’ talent rather than sink them down to a useless, easy level.”I giggled.\nShe was right.\nAt the end of the day, this made me question whether I was simply a product of that moment or if I was more than that.\nAfter delving deeper into introspection, I understood that while external influences shape us, they do not solely define who we are. Imagine our souls being like cymbals that clang not only when struck by the mallets that activate their resonance but also when surrounded by the negative reverberations of challenging experiences.\nHere’s another example: imagine people facing repeated setbacks in their careers. While these troubles influence their outlook, they do not mold who they are. Instead, their resilience and core values come into play, shaping how they navigate and ultimately transcend these challenges.\nBasically, even though external factors have a big say in our lives, they do not have the power to entirely sculpt the essence of who we are. Our souls resonate with a unique vibration that encompasses both external influences and intrinsic qualities, shaping the bronze that we present to the world.\nIn conclusion, my personal observation about how to find your mission:\nTo learn your mission, find your villain first.\nWe often think that our mission is something we must discover by digging deep into our souls, but the truth is: that it\u0026rsquo;s right in front of us, disguised as our villain. And this leads us to see that the villain is not only something to fear but to embrace. It hurts, but it’s the first step to using the lessons you learn to fuel your missions.\nIt is faster, easier, and utterly more effective than looking into yourself.\nIt helped me to see and to take action, to build on the bad moments. Your mission creates a positive impact: find your villain, discover the purpose and dedicate your life to forge the best possible world where it is worth to live in, for you and for who cames next.\nCover image by BRICK 101 on flickr\n",

It was like all the job I did with my team was not real, while it was succumbing under a machine gun that fires repeated shots full of convictions taken from who knows what life experience.\u003c/p\u003e"

                "content": "Empathy is the capacity to put oneself in the shoes of others.1\nIn other words, to understand how they view their reality and how they feel about things.\nEmpathy is feeling with people — Dr. Brené Brown\n@https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw\nEmpathy is a trainable skill. Here is a guide to learn how to be a person whom everyone talk to with joy.\nEmpathy classification According to Kendra Cherry, there are three kinds of empathy:\nAffective empathy involves understanding another person\u0026rsquo;s emotions and responding appropriately. Somatic empathy involves a physical mirroring of the feelings of the other. Cognitive empathy involves understanding another person\u0026rsquo;s mental state. Empathy is a trainable skill. People think that empathy is an innate capacity. They are wrong. Everyone can train it.\nEmpathy involves the skill of listening to what the other is saying and taking care of the other\u0026rsquo;s feelings outside your perspective.\nTheresa Wiseman identifies four attributes of Empathy:\nPerspective-taking Staying out of judgment Recognizing emotion in others Communicating back the feeling you see Graphic by the author\nThe Skills of Empathy When you approach Empathy, you must avoid problem-solving. Or telling. Empathy involves the rough acceptance of others\u0026rsquo; feelings. The fact is you can\u0026rsquo;t help people by changing their feelings.\nTo build your empathy skills, you can:\nListen to people without interrupting Pay attention to body language Don\u0026rsquo;t focus whether you agree or not with people Ask people deepening questions to understand their perspective Connect with moments in your life when you felt similar feelings Avoid minimization such as \u0026ldquo;Well, I know that it feels bad, but at least.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t digress to other subjects An Easier Approach to Empathy: Active Listening Active Listening is the foundational skill for empathy\nActive Listening provides the framework to develop a tool kit for empathy. It is a sequential process with four main steps.\nPassive listening (Silence) Opening (Warm invites) Verification of understanding (IIUC) Reflective Listening (paraphrase) Graphic by the author\nActive Listening — Step 1: Passive listening Passive listening means being silent and listening.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t understand another\u0026rsquo;s perspective without practicing silence.\nBut you must avoid prolonged passive listening.\nCommunication is an exchange and not reception of information. Try to imagine going to the doctor, only you speak, and he does not ask you anything looking at you in silence.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it weird?\nActive Listening — Step 2: Opening Help the other to open up and go deeper. Drive verbal and non-verbal messages that make it clear that you are listening.\nThose warm invites are an encouragement to continue. You can use words that emphasize what is said: \u0026rsquo;tell me, \u0026lsquo;I understand\u0026rsquo; but nods, smiles, and looks.\nActive Listening — Step 3: Verification of Understanding It\u0026rsquo;s time to activate. You can ask questions to clarify what you understood. Repeat what you listened to creates a trusted connection. It lets you check if you understand what you are being told. But you must act wisely: you are a scientist, and you use your superpower:\nFalsification.\nA scientific experiment removes progressively any reasonable doubt. It involves:\nBeing patient Conclusions are ephemeral. Forget your point of view. Assume the other is right and ask for help to get his perspective. I have good news for you, there is an easy superpower.\nIIUC, aka \u0026ldquo;If I Understand Correctly\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;If I Understand Correctly\u0026rdquo; are the words to break every barrier.\nIF These two letters are compelling because they instill doubt. It opens the way to an answer where the interlocutor\u0026rsquo;s opinion counts. Questioning shows you are fragile, the most incredible trust that exists.\nI **\u0026quot;We don\u0026rsquo;t talk about you. The problem is me!\u0026quot;. It is a natural sedative: \u0026ldquo;Hey, sorry, help me! Help me understand better what you just said\u0026rdquo;.\nUNDERSTAND You reveal that you want to understand.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, what interests me is to understand your point of view better. Nothing else. Let me understand you better.\u0026rdquo;\nCORRECTLY Here you are trying to clarify the content better.\nYou show good intentions to see if your understanding is correct.\nYour goal is clarity. We left the judgment to others.\nAfter starting with \u0026ldquo;If I understand correctly ..:\u0026rdquo; you can sincerely help the other clarify their thoughts, emotions, and needs behind the message.\nActive Listening — Step 4: Reflective Listening Eventually, you create reflections on what has been said.\nHere is the tipping point.\nDr. Carl Rogers believed that a therapist could best determine the client\u0026rsquo;s needs by listening intently. You go over the pure mirroring, and you reframe the message.\nReflective listening involves empathic paraphrasing. Using the exact words is helpful if you talk about facts and behaviors.\nIf you want to understand a person, it is best to paraphrase when he talks about thoughts, feelings, and desires. In these circumstances, people often speak using a very personal vocabulary. What is important to underline is that judgment and problem-solving are excluded from this listening mode.\nEmphatic paraphrasing tips:\nListen for key thoughts, feelings, and statements of facts. Use your own words to let the other person know what you think they meant. Be brief — you are trying to summarize key things said, not a word-for-word account. Avoid interpreting or jumping too far ahead of what the person has said. Conclusions Here are the main takeaways:\nEmpathy is feeling with people from their perspective. The good news is empathy is trainable. Active listening is the more effortless foundational skill to train empathy. Active listening has four steps: passive listening, opening, understanding of comprehension, reflective listening. \u0026ldquo;If I Understand Correctly:…\u0026rdquo; opens the door to effective listening. Be aware: being emphatic is a long life journey. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to travel along with others or it will be only an empty technique. Have a good listening.\nCover Picture by Matheus Ferrero on Unsplash\nDefinition by Dr. Thomas Gordon, an American clinical psychologist, who invented the Parent Effectiveness Parent, a skill program for parents.

Jim Collins1, former Stanford professor and author of “Good to Great”, calls them “Level 5 Leaders.”\nCollins examined organizations who leaped from Good to Great. The takeaway is that their leaders are not only focused on achieving results. Indeed, they observe the brutal facts and act accordingly.\nWhy?\nBecause it is the best way to help the next-in-line leaders.\nLeadership is learning not on processes but people. Great leaders are probably the smartest people in the room.\nYet, this is only an outcome of their scientific investigation. Instead, they focus on value creation. Eliminating waste is their mission.\nThey don’t do it alone, but they foster others’ engagement.\nHow?\nOutstanding leaders make propelling questions to help associates’ self-learning.\nThe organizations evolve through challenges won by people. Great leaders drop impossible challenges.\nAnd their associates reach them.\nThat is why it is vital to work with people and elevate their confidence. In great organizations, you expect people to be excited about challenges. The final consideration is that great organizations don’t believe people are a treasure.\nGreat people are.\nAnd they help them to change the world.\nJames C. Collins (born 1958) is an American researcher, author, speaker and consultant focused on the subject of business management and company sustainability and growth.
