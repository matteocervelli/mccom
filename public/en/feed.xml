      <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated February 15, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LLMs are a tool that has recently been taking up a lot of space in the world, and also in how I approach my work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although they are not infallible, using these tools has allowed me to enhance my content creation capabilities and also to write code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every piece of content you see produced on the site was originally written by me in at least one of the languages I support, namely Italian and English. For translation, I often rely on an auto-translated first draft. Therefore, it may happen that one of the two languages presents verbal forms generated by an LLM that I haven&amp;rsquo;t completely rewritten, especially in older articles predating February 15, 2025, when I published the new version of the site on Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Purple Cow</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post collects my takeaway from the book: &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3E4vBx9&#34;&gt;The Purple Cow by Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing but an ingredient to be successful: being a Purple Cow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wait, what&amp;rsquo;s a Purple Cow?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Purple Cow is a concept defined by Seth Godin to indicate the extraordinary that allows a business to stand out from the mass and build success. It&amp;rsquo;s not just an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the necessary choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated: 2025-01-17&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This website was created by Matteo Cervelli using a mix of personal skills and AI. I previously had a website hosted and built on WordPress, but I decided to rebuild it myself in early 2025 to &amp;ldquo;keep control&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a lightweight, fast, and responsive website. And I wanted to learn the basics by leveraging what technology has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, matteocervelli.com is a static website. It&amp;rsquo;s built with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; as SSG—Static Site Generator—and is hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, while DNS is managed through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My strength lies precisely in combining my experience as a family business partner + medium/large company management + international sales with my skills as a Scalability Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tightrope Walker Manager: Mastering Leadership&#39;s Balancing Act</title>
      <link>https://matteocervelli.com/en/tightrope-walker-manager/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes 20 years to build a new manager. 20 years where those responsible for delegating constantly oscillate on the edge of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risk-behind-delegation&#34;&gt;The risk behind delegation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like tightrope walkers, managers swing between the fear of being surpassed by people who might have something more than them and the risk that their team will lose drive and, ultimately, competitiveness by relying on inadequate people. Leaders who take the path of delegation risk falling painfully. But those who make it and get to the end receive applause from the audience—the same audience that lives in constant expectation of the fatal misstep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Find Your Villain, Learn Your Mission</title>

      <guid>https://matteocervelli.com/en/find-your-villain-learn-your-mission/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a villain. I got acquainted with mine five years ago in a meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a hot summer day, and I was presenting a quarter update about a company we recently acquired. We couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I was showing a PowerPoint filled with data and insights. Suddenly, Mr. Bowser started giving his own vision of the world, not caring about the information I provided. It was like all the job I did with my team was not real, while it was succumbing under a machine gun that fires repeated shots full of convictions taken from who knows what life experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have met many entrepreneurs, many good CEOs and a few extraordinary ones. Matteo has the courage to go further, from a human point of view and from a business vision point of view. He also has the stamina needed day by day to build that vision. It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to work with him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of working with Matteo for a long period during which he proved to be exceptionally reliable and focused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of his greatest qualities is his ability to plan and manage complex projects. His ability to foresee different scenarios and create detailed plans has led to significant improvements in operations and processes within our team. Thanks to his far-sighted perspective and attention to detail, he has generated a significant positive impact on our work, contributing to everyone&amp;rsquo;s growth and the achievement of objectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matteo is a figure who embodies curiosity and intellectual energy. His lively gaze reflects a mind that is never satisfied with superficial or banal answers. Always looking for the why of things, Matteo does not limit himself to observing the surface, but immerses himself directly in the essence of the issues to understand how to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His attitude towards innovation and change is contagious and inspiring. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about wanting to improve existing processes, but about transforming the entire organizational structure into something beautiful and meaningful. This vision of beauty is not limited to aesthetics, but extends to the beauty of efficient functioning, long-term goal, and the personal and professional growth of the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matteo is a person with vision, who does not give up reading beyond the surface. He loves to dare to set himself challenges that are concrete but at the same time above the line of &amp;ldquo;immediately feasible&amp;rdquo;. This attitude can be viral and also allows the people around him to look beyond the immediately achievable results (often of modest value), to set themselves more ambitious and certainly more satisfying goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matteo is a guide who accompanies me towards objectives aimed at personal and work improvement. An ally who taught me to always ask myself stimulating questions, and from their answers I always learned new things. I remember the first day of Kata, with his enthusiasm he involved me in a project that allowed us to overcome challenges that previously seemed like utopias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In just a few months we have doubled our daily door production, reaching 100 pieces per day. But the thing that made me grow the most was my attitude to change. He gave me the tools, and taught me how to use them, and thanks to this no new role or task scares me, I have been purchasing manager, manager of a production department and delivery manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve known Matteo for a few years now, because we attended a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree together at the Universities of Pisa, Florence, Siena and Scuola Superiore Sant&amp;rsquo;Anna&amp;hellip; to learn to climb! By participating in the master&amp;rsquo;s course with Matteo I understood that for him climbing is not just a way to reach the top, but above all THE way to determine an impact in the world that is sustainable (from all points of view, i.e. social, economic and of governance) and therefore be successful in the broadest and noblest sense of the term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I met Matteo in the company I work for, he is a very prepared and determined person, Matteo is a mentor, working with him, in addition to being a privilege, is very important: his ability to vision the future combined with external reality, and his way of transmitting it has always been a source of great motivation for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every project, every goal to be achieved, always becomes challenging and at the same time educational. The way in which he structured and made tangible the company&amp;rsquo;s values, which have become our cornerstones, was so engaging that to this day they do not allow us to lose our way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matteo is for me inspiration, support, respect and passion for life. We worked closely together for two years, in which I grew every single day thanks to his contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matteo is inspiration, because he is constantly looking for new methods, tools, points of view and loves to share all his discoveries. In this way he is a source of inspiration, both for new activities or systems to share, and for being curious and open to new things like he is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I had the chance to talk to Matteo I noticed his natural and determined propensity for all types of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, what aroused great interest in me was his idea of organisation, based on creating a structured and internally coherent structure with very clear and long-term objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not just a desire to change to improve the process, both productive and managerial, to be able to make those improvements that make company life more fluid, but to &amp;ldquo;give&amp;rdquo; everyone a concept of company based on &amp;ldquo;beauty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are a person with an extraordinary learning ability, you can see things that others don&amp;rsquo;t see but that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You travel a lot (mentally) into the future and this sometimes makes you lose contact with the present, perhaps this makes it difficult for you to communicate with other people (difficulty in making yourself understood) but it is precious for boosting activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You care a lot about the human side of people, this does you a lot of credit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matteo is one of the brightest minds I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After our common path at University, Matteo become a sort of personal consultant to get in touch with for sincere and effettive advices when facing the most complex milestone of my career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His business acumen, paired with his skills from his deep organizational experience and his talent in motivating and leading teams are remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am truly fascinated by Matteo&amp;rsquo;s natural leadership and ability to make things happen. He naturally connects and engages with stakeholders at all levels of an organization by his energetic, positive and easy style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matteo is undoubtedly a person out of the ordinary for the way he is able to think and see certain things and sometimes he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize this, risking &amp;ldquo;running alone&amp;rdquo; but as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned the experience, or rather the opportunity that he gave me and that I would like to tell you about, I believe, represents very well the concept of &amp;ldquo;talent development&amp;rdquo; that he carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After having completed a very important training course himself, he decided not to reserve that experience for himself but to share it with me, allowing me to follow the same path, this allowed me to come into contact with people and skills that I would never have imagined and for me this represents a very beautiful and clear form of how to make those around you and in whom you strongly believe grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders of great organizations focus all efforts on finding their successors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most successful bosses don’t micromanage. Instead, they help people to have greater responsibility. And to make this, the leader’s role change from a problem solver to a people enabler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, micro-management has bad side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bureaucracy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Less time spent on long term success&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The company don’t resist over the actual leader&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is what great leaders do, instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
