      <title>The 3 Pillars of Scalability: The Essential Elements for a Successful Business</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/3-pillars-of-scalability/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;150-grams&#34;&gt;150 grams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know why cashmere costs so much? Because the raw material is rare. Cashmere production is based on the wool produced by the so-called common goat, the Capra hircus, the classic white goat, considered one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_world%27s_100_worst_invasive_species&#34;&gt;100 most invasive species in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 grams is the amount of cashmere a goat produces in a year. In fact, cashmere is obtained by combing the goat&amp;rsquo;s neck, not shearing. And to produce cashmere, the goat must live in very cold regions, which develop secondary follicles creating this undercoat from which the wool is derived. Hand-combed, cared for, and prepared through a very labor-intensive process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tightrope Walker Manager: Mastering Leadership&#39;s Balancing Act</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/tightrope-walker-manager/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes 20 years to build a new manager. 20 years where those responsible for delegating constantly oscillate on the edge of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risk-behind-delegation&#34;&gt;The risk behind delegation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like tightrope walkers, managers swing between the fear of being surpassed by people who might have something more than them and the risk that their team will lose drive and, ultimately, competitiveness by relying on inadequate people. Leaders who take the path of delegation risk falling painfully. But those who make it and get to the end receive applause from the audienceâ€”the same audience that lives in constant expectation of the fatal misstep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
