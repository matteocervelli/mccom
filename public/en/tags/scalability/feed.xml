      <title>The Tightrope Walker Manager: Mastering Leadership&#39;s Balancing Act</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes 20 years to build a new manager. 20 years where those responsible for delegating constantly oscillate on the edge of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risk-behind-delegation&#34;&gt;The risk behind delegation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like tightrope walkers, managers swing between the fear of being surpassed by people who might have something more than them and the risk that their team will lose drive and, ultimately, competitiveness by relying on inadequate people. Leaders who take the path of delegation risk falling painfully. But those who make it and get to the end receive applause from the audienceâ€”the same audience that lives in constant expectation of the fatal misstep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
