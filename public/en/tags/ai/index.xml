      <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated February 15, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LLMs are a tool that has recently been taking up a lot of space in the world, and also in how I approach my work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although they are not infallible, using these tools has allowed me to enhance my content creation capabilities and also to write code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every piece of content you see produced on the site was originally written by me in at least one of the languages I support, namely Italian and English. For translation, I often rely on an auto-translated first draft. Therefore, it may happen that one of the two languages presents verbal forms generated by an LLM that I haven&amp;rsquo;t completely rewritten, especially in older articles predating February 15, 2025, when I published the new version of the site on Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
