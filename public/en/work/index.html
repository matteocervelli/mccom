<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<p>I unlock people&rsquo;s talent and potential to build a more beautiful world together.</p>
<h3 id="how">How</h3>
<p>I help companies grow in a scalable way, to build ecosystems that enable comfort, skills, and overall well-being.</p>

<p>I work as a consultant, advisor, and trainer, as well as making personal investments.</p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beauty</strong> is the key to unleashing creativity and eliminating poverty.</li>
<li>Whether you choose easy or difficult <strong>challenges</strong>, they require the same energy. Always aim high.</li>
<li>Learning, <strong>failing</strong>, and trying again are the only ways to grow.</li>
<li>A company&rsquo;s capability is its unique value proposition, its potential lies in the strength of <strong>relationships</strong> that leadership maintains.</li>
<li>An evolving business is based on few <strong>experiments</strong>, but with great potential. And at the same time, many diversified stimuli of mammoth opportunities that simmer quietly.</li>

<h2 id="services-i-offer">Services I offer</h2>
<h3 id="management-consulting">Management Consulting</h3>
<p>My consulting services are customized to <a href="/en/business-scalability-engineer">unlock your company&rsquo;s potential</a> and guide you toward success. Working together, we&rsquo;ll transform challenges into opportunities. I can support you with tailored methodologies, strategic vision, insights, and operational excellence.</p>
<p>My method consists of 3 modes (which together constitute a continuous improvement process):</p>
<h4 id="initial-assessment">Initial Assessment</h4>
<p>Choose your pace, accelerated one-week path or distributed path over a month.</p>
<p>The result is an in-depth report, as a good engineer would provide, that helps identify growth obstacles, how to speed up the business, and the action plan.</p>
<h4 id="project-sprint-and-implementation">Project Sprint and Implementation</h4>
<p>13 weeks (one quarter) where we will explore, design, and implement the solution to the problems or opportunities encountered.</p>
<p>The goal is to bring tangible and measurable results in a short time, to test few things, but relevant ones.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-advisory">Continuous Advisory</h4>
<p>Ongoing support to advise, monitor, and develop company and people processes and capabilities; to set the pace and ensure actions proceed.</p>
<p>I operate with coaching methods in this mode.</p>
<h3 id="fractional-executive">Fractional Executive</h3>
<p>I specialize in optimizing business processes.</p>
<p>I thoroughly analyze every aspect to ensure efficient and smooth operation.</p>
<p>My goal is to transform ideas into concrete and meaningful results, offering you a complete strategic perspective to guide your company&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Compared to pure consulting, the Fractional Executive takes on responsibility exercised in a reduced space. One/two days a week.</p>
<p>The Fractional Executive is the best answer to bring in skills not present in the company when there&rsquo;s no room for a full-time executive.</p>
<h3 id="independent-board-member">Independent Board Member</h3>
<p>As an independent board member, I bring a fresh perspective, strategic vision, and the ability to stimulate reflection through targeted questions.</p>
<p>I am committed to contributing to your organization&rsquo;s growth and success through my experience and unique point of view.</p>
<p>The strength of companies lies in their Relational Capability, in the network they generate.</p>
<p>An independent board member also ensures a much better score for ESG issues.</p>
<h3 id="training-and-teaching">Training and Teaching</h3>
<p>I strongly believe in the transformative power of knowledge. My training programs are carefully designed to elevate skills, increase confidence, and promote innovation.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re interested in an academic course, a testimony of my experience, or a corporate training program, I can help you convey an effective message.</p>
<p>Along with training, we can activate support and coaching paths.</p>
