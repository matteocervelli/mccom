<p>I&rsquo;m Matteo Cervelli. I am <a href="/work/business-scalability-engineer">Business Scalability Engineer</a>. I act as a <a href="/en/work/">Consultant and Advisor</a>. Previously I managed <a href="https://www.urania.group">Urania Group</a> as Co-CEO.</p>
<p>Today I help entrepreneurs and leaders to grow their business, in strategy, management, sales, implementing the principles of scalability.</p>
<p>My purpose is to trigger people to build a more beautiful world, together.</p>
<p>I am a father of 3 little girls, Emma, ​​Maria and Emma, ​​and two dogs: Maple and Cookie. Even before that, I am a husband: Sara and I have known each other since 2005 and in these 20 years we have loved each other and have always been there for each other, one, two and infinite.</p>
<p>I live in Tuscany.</p>
<p>On thwebsite, you can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="/en/posts/">essays and thoughts</a></li>
<li>My <a href="/en/work/">work method</a></li>
<li>What I am focused on <a href="/en/now/">now</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="welcome-to-my-garden">Welcome to my garden</h2>
<p>This is my digital home. You can find my thoughts, my writings and how to work with me.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I work to build businesses that scale, I work with people and through a union of purpose, we are able to build ecosystems that bring beauty.</p>
<p>There is a thread that unites parenting, education and doing business: triggering talent. Everyone has unexpressed potential and through my work, I strive to ensure that this emerges.</p>
<p>As a leader, this translates into the continuous search for autonomy of collaborators, an approach that can be adapted to all contexts. Driven by purpose.</p>
<h2 id="my-main-skills">My main skills</h2>
<p>My main advantage is that of having operated as CEO of a medium/large company, present in many countries. In addition to speaking many languages, English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, in addition to my mother tongue Italian, I have seen many cultures and learned to sell by going directly to customers&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p>I have dealt with entrepreneurs and managers of large billion-dollar companies, financed by Private Equity.</p>
<p>In the company, a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Family Business, I saw M&amp;A, strategy, finance and specialized in change management, a skill, a real method for grounding changes.</p>
<p>As an Engineer, I build methods, or apply them, to make things more effective. By the way, I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to make processes more repeatable and scalable, exponentially.</p>
<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>2025 — We launch a new consulting project called <a href="https://adlimen.com">Ad Limen Consulting</a>, specifically aimed at supporting business scalability.</p>
<p>2024 — In July I leave the management of <a href="https://www.urania.group">Urania Group</a>, I remain a partner. I started my own management consulting business. I invest in <a href="https://mokapen.it">Mokapen</a> and we start the Business Angel Club of Pisa.</p>
<p>2022 — Complete, first ever, the Master in Scalability and Company Growth, organized by the Universities of Pisa, Florence, Siena and <a href="https://www.santannapisa.it/en">Scuola Sant&rsquo;Anna</a>. I launch my own website, for the first time, and begin to explore publishing content.</p>
<p>2021 — Together with the role of CEO in <a href="https://www.serrall.com">Serrall</a>, I acquire that of CSO in Pan Urania</p>
<p>2020 — With COVID we start a heavy digital revolution and I acquire complete management of the Serrall company.</p>
<p>2019 — Emma is born. At Serrall we turn processes around with the <a href="https://www.lean.org/explore-lean/what-is-lean/">Lean approach</a>, <a href="https://kanbanize.com/lean-management/hoshin-kanri/what-is-hoshin-kanri">Hoshin Kanri</a> and <a href="https://www.toyota-global.com/company/toyota_traditions/quality/mar_apr_2008.html">Toyota Kata</a>.</p>
<p>2018 — Maple arrives in the family. And I move, as CEO, to restructure the Serrall company, in Umbria, which went through an M&amp;A operation.</p>
<p>2016 — After a period as Innovation Manager, I moved to the PanHouse project where, as PM, we rebuilt the New School of Cittareale, which was destroyed in the summer earthquake, in just 19 days of construction.</p>
<p>2015 — I completed my Master&rsquo;s Degree in <a href="https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english/course/10275">Management Engineering</a>—<em>Ingegneria Gestionale</em> in italian— in Pisa with 110 cum laude.</p>
<p>2014 — I get married to Sara. The same year I began my first serious job in Pan Urania. I start working on industrial innovation, but almost immediately I end up doing 3 years as an Area Manager in Brazil.</p>
<p>1988 — I was born in Poggibonsi, Tuscany.</p>
