&lt;p>LLMs are a tool that has recently been taking up a lot of space in the world, and also in how I approach my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although they are not infallible, using these tools has allowed me to enhance my content creation capabilities and also to write code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every piece of content you see produced on the site was originally written by me in at least one of the languages I support, namely Italian and English. For translation, I often rely on an auto-translated first draft. Therefore, it may happen that one of the two languages presents verbal forms generated by an LLM that I haven&amp;rsquo;t completely rewritten, especially in older articles predating February 15, 2025, when I published the new version of the site on Netlify.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technologies used to build this site</title><link>https://matteocervelli.com/en/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:12:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matteocervelli.com/en/tech-stack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Updated: 2025-01-17&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This website was created by Matteo Cervelli using a mix of personal skills and AI. I previously had a website hosted and built on WordPress, but I decided to rebuild it myself in early 2025 to &amp;ldquo;keep control&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted a lightweight, fast, and responsive website. And I wanted to learn the basics by leveraging what technology has to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, matteocervelli.com is a static website. It&amp;rsquo;s built with &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a> as SSG—Static Site Generator—and is hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify&lt;/a> via &lt;a href="https://github.com">GitHub&lt;/a>, while DNS is managed through &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://matteocervelli.com/en/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 17:26:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matteocervelli.com/en/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="in-short">In short&lt;/h2>
