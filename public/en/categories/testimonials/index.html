      <p>I had the pleasure of working with Matteo for a long period during which he proved to be exceptionally reliable and focused.</p>
<p>One of his greatest qualities is his ability to plan and manage complex projects. His ability to foresee different scenarios and create detailed plans has led to significant improvements in operations and processes within our team. Thanks to his far-sighted perspective and attention to detail, he has generated a significant positive impact on our work, contributing to everyone&rsquo;s growth and the achievement of objectives.</p>

      <p>Matteo is a figure who embodies curiosity and intellectual energy. His lively gaze reflects a mind that is never satisfied with superficial or banal answers. Always looking for the why of things, Matteo does not limit himself to observing the surface, but immerses himself directly in the essence of the issues to understand how to improve.</p>
<p>His attitude towards innovation and change is contagious and inspiring. It&rsquo;s not just about wanting to improve existing processes, but about transforming the entire organizational structure into something beautiful and meaningful. This vision of beauty is not limited to aesthetics, but extends to the beauty of efficient functioning, long-term goal, and the personal and professional growth of the people around him.</p>

      <p>Matteo is a person with vision, who does not give up reading beyond the surface. He loves to dare to set himself challenges that are concrete but at the same time above the line of &ldquo;immediately feasible&rdquo;. This attitude can be viral and also allows the people around him to look beyond the immediately achievable results (often of modest value), to set themselves more ambitious and certainly more satisfying goals.</p>

      <p>Matteo is a guide who accompanies me towards objectives aimed at personal and work improvement. An ally who taught me to always ask myself stimulating questions, and from their answers I always learned new things. I remember the first day of Kata, with his enthusiasm he involved me in a project that allowed us to overcome challenges that previously seemed like utopias.</p>
<p>In just a few months we have doubled our daily door production, reaching 100 pieces per day. But the thing that made me grow the most was my attitude to change. He gave me the tools, and taught me how to use them, and thanks to this no new role or task scares me, I have been purchasing manager, manager of a production department and delivery manager.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve known Matteo for a few years now, because we attended a Master&rsquo;s degree together at the Universities of Pisa, Florence, Siena and Scuola Superiore Sant&rsquo;Anna&hellip; to learn to climb! By participating in the master&rsquo;s course with Matteo I understood that for him climbing is not just a way to reach the top, but above all THE way to determine an impact in the world that is sustainable (from all points of view, i.e. social, economic and of governance) and therefore be successful in the broadest and noblest sense of the term.</p>

<p>Every project, every goal to be achieved, always becomes challenging and at the same time educational. The way in which he structured and made tangible the company&rsquo;s values, which have become our cornerstones, was so engaging that to this day they do not allow us to lose our way.</p>

      <p>The first time I had the chance to talk to Matteo I noticed his natural and determined propensity for all types of innovation.</p>
<p>However, what aroused great interest in me was his idea of organisation, based on creating a structured and internally coherent structure with very clear and long-term objectives.</p>
<p>It is not just a desire to change to improve the process, both productive and managerial, to be able to make those improvements that make company life more fluid, but to &ldquo;give&rdquo; everyone a concept of company based on &ldquo;beauty&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>Matteo is one of the brightest minds I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>

      <p>Matteo is undoubtedly a person out of the ordinary for the way he is able to think and see certain things and sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t realize this, risking &ldquo;running alone&rdquo; but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned the experience, or rather the opportunity that he gave me and that I would like to tell you about, I believe, represents very well the concept of &ldquo;talent development&rdquo; that he carried out.</p>
<p>After having completed a very important training course himself, he decided not to reserve that experience for himself but to share it with me, allowing me to follow the same path, this allowed me to come into contact with people and skills that I would never have imagined and for me this represents a very beautiful and clear form of how to make those around you and in whom you strongly believe grow.</p>
