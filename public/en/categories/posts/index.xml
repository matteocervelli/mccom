      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a villain. I got acquainted with mine five years ago in a meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a hot summer day, and I was presenting a quarter update about a company we recently acquired. We couldnâ€™t see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I was showing a PowerPoint filled with data and insights. Suddenly, Mr. Bowser started giving his own vision of the world, not caring about the information I provided. It was like all the job I did with my team was not real, while it was succumbing under a machine gun that fires repeated shots full of convictions taken from who knows what life experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
